<h1>Operation #4: Sequential Execution</h1>
<p>Together our first four commands make a little program and illustrate the
fourth operation: sequential execution.</p>
<pre><code>speed = input()
duration = input()
distance = duration * speed
print distance</code></pre>
<p>By default the computer executes statements in the order they are
presented, from first to last, top to bottom (the same order in which we are
used to reading). Note that the order can be crucial. Our program will still
work if we swap the first two statements, but most other reorderings will
produce errors. For example swapping the second and third ones,</p>
<pre><code>speed = input()
distance = duration * speed
duration = input()
print distance</code></pre>
<p>or the second and fourth ones,</p>
<pre><code>speed = input()
print distance
distance = duration * speed
duration = input()</code></pre>
<p>or the third and fourth ones,</p>
<pre><code>speed = input()
duration = input()
print distance
distance = duration * speed</code></pre>
<p>To understand why each of these other orderings results in an error try
stepping through the effects of the statements using a functional diagram of
a computer. If you do so precisely you will soon see the problem created by
each reordering. This ability to step through a program precisely (or to play
computer) is the key skill in debugging programs.</p>
<p>It is also instructive to try running each of these programs in Python
(you'll see how to do this shortly) to see the error messages they generate.
You'll be seeing a lot of error messages this term, and until you know what
conditions create them they can appear inscrutable. So the sooner you get to
know them the easier it will be for you to debug your own programs. </p>
<p>With the first three commands, and the default sequential execution
behaviour, we can write programs that gather input, process it, and output
results. But with only sequential execution they must always process the
input in the same way. These programs are calculator like: You gather the
numbers you need, process them and look at the answer. We will refer to them
as SIPO (Sequential Input, Processing, Output) programs. This is the only
type of program you will need to write for the next module's assignment, but
since there are only two more fundamental operations I want to introduce them
to you now. We'll look at them in depth in Modules 3 and 4. </p>
