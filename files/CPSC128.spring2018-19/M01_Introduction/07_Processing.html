<h1>Operation #2: Processing</h1>
<p>Once we have the necessary data in memory we "process" it. Processing
refers to the manipulation of data stored in memory. Most procedural
languages use an assignment statement to specify the processing to be
performed. The form of an assignment statement is: <i>name</i> =
<i>expression</i>. The assignment statement instructs the computer to
calculate the value of <em>expression</em> and to store the result and label
it <em>name</em>. Here's an example in Python,</p>
<pre><code>distance = duration * speed </code> </pre>
<p>This statement causes the processor to retrieve the values of
<code>duration</code> and <code>speed</code> from memory, multiply them,
store the result in memory and label it <code>distance</code>. The effect on
the state of the computer is shown below.</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="07_ComputerPostProc.gif"

<p>That assignment statement looks a lot like a mathematical equation. This
is a holdover from one of the earliest programming languages FORTRAN (short
for FORmula TRANslator), and is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing
because most people have some experience with equations, and assignment
statements are a lot like equations. It is a curse because they are not
<em>exactly</em> like equations.</p>
<p>The first unimportant difference is that the statement above uses an
asterisk to specify multiplication where we are used to using a times symbol, &times;, that looks like an x. However
most computer languages can't use an x for multiplication because x could be
a name, and computers don't have an easy way to tell which x's in your
program mean perform a multiplication and which ones are names. To avoid
confusion an entirely different symbol, <code>*</code>, is used for
multiplication. This is not Python-specific all the mainstream languages use
the <code>*</code> for multiplication. In fact humans don't really use x for
both multiplication and names, we just think we do because of the limited
choices on our computer keyboard. When we write with a more flexible tool
though, like a pen on paper, we usually use <span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><em>x</em></span> as a name and &times;
for multiplication. The other basic operators are the ones you are used
to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>+</code> for addition</li>
  <li><code>-</code> for subtraction</li>
  <li><code>/</code> for division</li>
</ul>
<p>The other basic operation is exponentiation or informally "powers". When
we do math on paper we write 2<sup>3</sup> for "two cubed" or 2 &times; 2
&times; 2 but early programming languages had no easy way to type a
superscript and so adopted other notations. Python uses <code>**</code> for
exponentiation so <code>2**3</code> for two-cubed (the other common choice in
programming languages is ^ or 2^3). The pair of asterisks is to remind us of
repeated multiplication.</p>
<p>The fact that assignment statements look a bit like equations, has
prompted many people to refer to the names of memory locations (i.e.
<code>rate</code>, <code>duration</code> and <code>distance</code>) as
<em>variables</em>, and programmers do this too. It's not inaccurate since
the same name can refer to different values at different times in the life of a program. But it is
crucial to remember that assignment statements are <em>not</em> equations.
To emphasize this consider the following example,</p>
<pre><code>x = x + 1</code></pre>
<p>Depending on how long it's been since you thought about equations carefully
this may not look odd at first, but mathematically it is nonsense because
there is no number that is equal to itself plus 1! 
<p>It is however perfectly valid and sensible Python. Here's how the computer
interprets it. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fetch the value of x from memory, add 1 to it, and then store the result
  back in memory labelling the new value x.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in Python this assignment statement says to increment the value of x by
1. The key here is that assignment statements should be read from right to
left. Remember the form of the assignment statement was: <i>name</i> =
<em>expression</em>. The expression on the right is evaluated and the result
stored using the name on the left. Note that the expression is always on the
right and the name always on the left. While it is ok to write <code>x = x +
1</code> Python will complain and generate an error message if you write
<code>x + 1 = x</code>. Try it in IDLE and see.</p>
