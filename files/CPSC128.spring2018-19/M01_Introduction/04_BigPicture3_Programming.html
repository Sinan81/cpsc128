<h1>Big Picture 3: Programming</h1>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: So I had an idea of what a computer is, and what a
program is, but I still wasn't sure what computer programming was so I googled
<a
href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=&quot;computer+programming+is&quot;">"computer
programming is"</a> and it led me to this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Computer Programming is a field that involves the methodology behind the
  programming, software abstraction, algorithms, data structures, design,
  testing, and maintenance of computer software.(<a
  href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Topic:Computer_Programming">Wikiversity</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is more detail than I needed. Could you just tell me what a computer
program is?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: A list of instructions telling the computer what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: And programming is writing down those instructions?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Well you have to think of them first, but yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: That sounds pretty straightforward. Why do some people
find it hard?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Well there are a few catches.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sometimes it's not obvious how to represent things using symbols.</li>
  <li>The computer doesn't speak English, so <em>you</em> have to learn
    <em>its</em> language.</li>
  <li><a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">Computer
    languages</a> don't refer to the natural world we are used to of sun,
    sky, trees, people, desks, etc. They refer to objects in their own
  worlds.</li>
  <li>The computer can only do very simple manipulations at each step
    (remember its processor is not much more powerful than a handheld
    calculator), so you have to specify things in (sometimes excruciating)
    detail.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: That doesn't sound so good. Is there a bright side?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Sure,</p>
<ol>
  <li>While the words in computer languages may refer to an unfamiliar world,
    it is a shockingly simple world. For example many of them are built on just six key
    concepts.</li>
  <li>Although computers don't speak English, the languages they do use
    contain very few words (the <a
    href="http://docs.python.org/ref/keywords.html">complete list of Python
    keywords</a> contains only 31 words).</li>
  <li>A large set of techniques has been developed to deal with commonly
    occuring situations, so you almost never have to start from scratch. As a
    student your job is to learn those techniques.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main goal of this course is to teach you those concepts, in that
language, and to put them to use using those techniques.</p>
<p class="attn">For more see Wikipedia's page on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer
Programming</a>. You won't be examined on it, but reading it over will
provide you with invaluable background information, of the sort that would
often come up during face-to-face classes. It introduces many of the major
concepts and concerns that occupy programmers. You won't understand every bit
of it on first reading, but that's okay; the ideas will recur as you move
through the course.</p>
