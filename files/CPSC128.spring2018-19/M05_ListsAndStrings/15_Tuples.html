<h1>Tuples</h1>
<p>In <a href="08_PlayingCards.html">Representing Playing Cards</a> there was the unfamiliar line,</p>
<pre><code>(deck[posn1], deck[posn2]) = (deck[posn2], deck[posn1])</code></pre>
<p>The items on each side of the equals sign are <em>tuples</em>. You know you are
looking at a tuple because of the round parentheses , i.e. (), surrounding
it*. Tuples are a bit of an odd duck data type. They work much like lists, except that
they are immutable, i.e. they can't be changed (which means that many list
methods can't be applied to them). What use is a list you can't change? Not
very much generally, but there are some special cases where that combination of properties is just the ticket. This is one of them, so
let's get back to that code. What is this code</p>
<pre><code>(deck[posn1], deck[posn2]) = (deck[posn2], deck[posn1])</code></pre>
<p>doing? It is swapping the values of <code>deck[posn1]</code> and <code>deck[posn2]</code>. A simpler
example would be,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5 # set a
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 1 # set b
&gt;&gt;&gt; (a,b) = (b,a) # swap the values of a and b
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print b
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>
<p>Here a tuple is created on the right side and unpacked into the target
tuple on the left hand side. The statement says, reading it left to right,
assign the names <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> the values named by <code>b</code> and <code>a</code>. The magic of tuple
packing and unpacking makes this seem to happen in parallel so no values get
overwritten before their time. The net effect is to swap the names on the
values 5 and 1.</p>
<p>Now you should be able to look at the earlier deck code  and see what it is
doing.</p>
<h2>Swapping in other languages</h2>
<p>Tuples are a Python oddity. In most other languages you swap variables
using a temporary variable. To do the second swap above you would do
something like,</p>
<pre><code>a = 5
b = 1
...
temp = a
a = b
b = temp</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>*Language lawyers will point out that the tuple constructor is the comma,
not the parentheses and they'd be right, but standard practice is to surround
tuples with a more visible marker like ()s, which I will do and so will you!</p>
