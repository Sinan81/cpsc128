<h1>Playing Cards: An alternative representation</h1>
<p>So far we have represented a deck of cards by a list of unique numbers. This
made it convenient to initialize using <code>deck = range(52)</code>, but
required some work  to get a card's suit and face value given its
card number.</p>
<p>An alternative representation would begin by noting that each card has two
characteristics, i.e. a suit and a face value, so perhaps we should represent
each card by a pair of values. For example the two of clubs could be
represented by the pair of values "2" and "C" (for clubs) and the Queen of
Hearts could be represented by "Q" and "H". A brand new deck would look
like:</p>
<pre>
<code>deck = [['A','C'], ['2','C'], ['3','C'], ['4','C'], ['5','C'], ['6','C'], ['7','C'],
['8','C'], ['9','C'], ['10','C'], ['J','C'], ['Q','C'], ['K','C'],
['A','D'], ['2','D'], ['3','D'], ['4','D'], ['5','D'], ['6','D'], ['7','D'],
['8','D'], ['9','D'], ['10','D'], ['J','D'], ['Q','D'], ['K','D'],
['A','H'], ['2','H'], ['3','H'], ['4','H'], ['5','H'], ['6','H'], ['7','H'],
['8','H'], ['9','H'], ['10','H'], ['J','H'], ['Q','H'], ['K','H'],
['A','S'], ['2','S'], ['3','S'], ['4','S'], ['5','S'], ['6','S'], ['7','S'],
['8','S'], ['9','S'], ['10','S'], ['J','S'], ['Q','S'], ['K','S']]</code></pre>
<p>This list is both repetitive and long meaning there is a good chance of
making an inconspicuous error when typing it in by hand (Quick! Have I made
an error above? Can't easily tell? That's  the point.) Since there is a clear
repetitive pattern in the list we should be able to generate it
programmatically.</p>
<p>The nature of the pattern is that the first item in the pair goes from
'A', to '2', and on to 'K' four times. The second element changes more
slowly. It is 'C' for the first 13 elements, then 'D' for the next 13, then
'H' and finally 'S' for the final 13. This pattern of a slowly changing value
and a quickly changing one reminds me of nested loops and suggests this
code,</p>
<pre><code class="python">FACE_VALUES = [<span class="string">'A'</span>, <span class="string">'2'</span>, <span class="string">'3'</span>, <span class="string">'4'</span>, <span class="string">'5'</span>, <span class="string">'6'</span>, <span class="string">'7'</span>, <span class="string">'8'</span>, <span class="string">'9'</span>, <span class="string">'10'</span>,
               <span class="string">'J'</span>, <span class="string">'Q'</span>, <span class="string">'K'</span>]
SUITS = [<span class="string">'C'</span>, <span class="string">'D'</span>, <span class="string">'H'</span>, <span class="string">'S'</span>]

deck = []
<span class="keyword">for</span> suit <span class="keyword">in</span> SUITS :
    <span class="keyword">for</span> face_value <span class="keyword">in</span> FACE_VALUES :
        deck.append([face_value, suit])</code></pre>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The maxim that<br />there is more than one way to do it<br />applies to data
representations just as much as to algorithms!</h2>
