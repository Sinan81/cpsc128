<h1>Assignment 5</h1>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
    <p>Write a program that looks at a list of lists representing a
    Tic-Tac-Toe game, determines if someone has won, and if so says who. (You
    can assume the game state has arisen in the course of a legal game).</p>
    <p>Embed your code in the file <a href="99_a5p1v1.py">a5p1v1.py</a></p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Dedup</h3>
    <p>Write a program that removes duplicate values from a list, i.e. if the
    list starts out as <code>[4, 2, 5, 2, 4]</code>, then after your code
    fragment runs it should be <code>[4, 2, 5]</code>.</p>
    <p>Embed your code in the file <a href="99_a5p2v1.py">a5p2v1.py</a></p>
    <p>(A real-life application would be to remove duplicates from a list of
    IP addresses so you have a list of unique visitors to your site. In this
    case the list might look like [ '10.9.0.31', '199.247.52.3', '10.9.0.31',
    '43.98.12.4', '72.1.3.55', '199.247.52.3', ...]).</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Poker Full House</h3>
    <p>Write a program that decides if a list of card numbers is a full
    house. A full house is a hand in which 3 cards share one face value and
    the other two share a different face value, e.g. three sevens and two
    aces. For example the list [6, 32, 39, 0, 45] is a full house because cards
    6, 32 and 45 are sevens and cards 39 and 0 are aces. (See <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands">Wikipedia</a> for
    more examples).</p>
    <p>Use the first representation shown in the module notes, i.e. the one
    in <a
    href="http://courses.yukoncollege.yk.ca/~ttopper/CPSC128.W14/M05_ListsAndStrings/PlayingCards.html">Representing
    Playing Cards</a>.</p>
    <!--<p>Write a program that decides if a list of card numbers is a straight.
                A straight is a hand in which the face values of the cards can be
                arranged in a sequence with no missing values. For example the list [6,
                35, 10, 20, 8] is a straight because the face values of those cards are
                Seven, Ten, Jack, Eight, and Nine which forms the sequence Seven, Eight,
                Nine, Ten, Jack. On the other hand neither the list [6, 35, 10, 20, 9]
                nor the list [5, 35, 10, 20, 8] form straights. The former because it
                contains two Tens, the latter because there is a hole in it because it
                doesn't have a Seven. (See <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands">Wikipedia</a> for
                more examples).</p>-->
    <p>Do not remove your test values from the program so I can see how
    thoroughly you tested your code. Feel free to adapt one of the test
    frameworks from the problems above to help you in testing your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Password checker</h3>
    <p>Most computer systems require the user to select a password.
    Unfortunately many users, perhaps most,  choose poor passwords, i.e.
    passwords that are easily guessed, or that can be looked up in a
    dictionary. Weak passwords present security problems because they
    compromise the integrity of the system. To avoid weak passwords many
    systems now test the password the user types, and decide whether to
    accept it or not. Here is an (abbreviated) excerpt from a manual
    describing the process on one actual system (where the name of the
    password program is <code>passwd</code>). Think of this as the
    specification for your program and try to implement it as precisely as
    possible (if you detect ambiguities in it be sure to ask for
    clarification).</p>
    <pre><code>When used to change a password, <b>passwd</b> prompts everyone  for
their  old  password,  if  any.  It then prompts for the new
password twice.  If the two copies are not identical the
cycle of prompting for the new password is repeated for at
most two more times.
When the two copies are identical a check is made to ensure
that the new  password meets construction requirements.
Passwords must be constructed to meet the following require-
ments:
*  Each password must have  at  least  six  characters.
*  Each password must contain at least  one  lower-case
alphabetic character, one upper-case alphabetic character,
and at least one numeric or special character.  In this
case,  "alphabetic"  refers  to  all upper or lower case
letters. (These requirements ensure they do not use a 
"word", i.e. a string that could be looked up in a
dictionary, or their phone/SIN/etc. number -- two common
choices).
*  Each password must differ from the user's login name
and the reverse of that login name.  For this comparison,
an upper case letter and its corresponding lower case letter
are equivalent.
*  New passwords must differ from the old in  at  least
three  positions.  For this comparison, an upper case
letter and its corresponding lower  case  letter are
equivalent.</code>			</pre>
    <p>Write a program that behaves as specified by this excerpt.</p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The real <code>passwd</code> program, after validating the proposed
        new password, encrypts it and writes it to a file, but we're omitting
        that final step ... for now!</li>
      <li>In actual use the program would make a "system call" to get the
        current user's login name. Since we have not seen how to do this yet,
        your program will have to read in the login name.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are a couple of sample outputs generated by running a solution
    program:</p>
    <pre><code>=============================================
Password Checker
---------------------------------------------
Enter the login name: ttopper
Enter your current password: sp33dKills
Enter new password: duckie
Confirm new password: duvkie
New passwords do not match!
Try again.
Enter new password: duckie
Confirm new password: duckie
Password must contain at least one upper case letter.
Password not acceptable.
Password not changed.
Done.</code></pre>
    <pre><code>=============================================
Password Checker
---------------------------------------------
Enter the login name: ttopper
Enter your current password: sp33dKills
Enter new password: d1cT10nary 
Confirm new password: d1cT10nary
Password changed.
Done.</code></pre>
    <p>Not the friendliest exchanges in the world, but hopefully clear
    enough.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the following naming scheme for your program files: <code>a</code><em>assignment#</em><code>p</code><em>problem#</em><code>v</code><em>version#</em><code>.py</code> . So your first attempt at problem 1 on this assignment will be named <code>a5p1v1.py</code> and your second attempt (should there be one) will
      be named <code>a5p1v2.py</code> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your assignment by emailing your python programs to me. I advise to submit early and submit often, since I will often review your programs as they are submitted and provide feedback that will let you improve them.</p>
