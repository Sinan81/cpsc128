<h1>Palindrome</h1>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Write a program that inputs a string and determines if it is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards or backwards, e.g.
"bob" and "madam". An excellent program would be able to deal with entire phrases by
ignoring capitalization, spaces and punctuation in the input, e.g. "A man, a
plan, a canal, Panama!" is a palindromic phrase and should be identified as
such.</p>
<h2>Solution 1</h2>
<p>Ignoring, for the moment, palindromic phrases and focussing instead on
words like "madam", the striking thing about a palindrome is that it is the
same forwards and backwards. That means that the first letter is the same as
the last letter, the second letter is the same as the second last letter,
etc. In pseudocode,</p>
<pre><code>if first_letter == last_letter and second_letter == second_last_letter and ...
    Then it is a palindrome.
else
    It is NOT a palindrome.</code></pre>
<p>Let's move this one step closer to Python by figuring out the indices of
those letter positions,</p>
<pre><code>if s[0]==s[len(s)-1] and s[1]==s[len(s)-2] and s[2]==s[len(s)-3] and ...
    Then it is a palindrome.
else
    It is NOT a palindrome.</code></pre>
<p>We have enough programming experience by now to see that this solution is
unworkable exactly as it is since we don't know ahead of time how many test
expressions we need (because we don't know ahead of time how long the string
is). But the concept is sound and we can make it workable if we replace the
<code>if</code> statement with a loop that iterates through the font half of the string
comparing the characters there to their counterparts in the back half of the
string. We'll use the same strategy to detect a palindrome that we did to <a
href="http://courses.yukoncollege.yk.ca/~ttopper/CPSC128.W14/M05_ListsAndStrings/PokerHands.html">detect
a flush in a poker hand</a>: Assume the word is a palindrome and then test to
see if we are right. As before we will use a flag variable to keep track.</p>
<pre><code>palindrome = True # Our flag variable.
for offset values from 0 to len(s)/2
    if s[offset] != s[len(s)-1-offset]
       palindrome = False
if palindrome
    then it is a palindrome
else
    It is NOT a palindrome</code></pre>
<p>Now it's a small step to actual Python (long live stepwise
refinement!):</p>
<pre><code class="python">s = <span class="string">"madam"</span>

palindrome = True
<span class="keyword">for</span> offset <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">0</span>, len(s)/<span class="number">2</span>):
    <span class="keyword">if</span> s[offset] != s[len(s)-<span class="number">1</span>-offset]:
       palindrome = False

<span class="keyword">if</span> palindrome:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"It is a palindrome!"</span>
<span class="keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"It is NOT a palindrome."</span></code></pre>
<h2>Solution 2</h2>
<p>Python is often described as a batteries-included language because its
built-in libraries are so extensive. We had good luck earlier finding short
solutions by leveraging the libraries so let's try that again.</p>
<p>A palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. That means
it is the same as its reverse. So, another approach would be to build the
reverse of a string and compare it to the original. If they are the same then
it's a palindrome. Lists have a built-in <code>reverse</code> method, but
unfortunately strings don't (because they are immutable they can't have a method that changes them). Still, perhaps we can convert our string to a
list. Let's try it in the Python shell and see,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "madam"
&gt;&gt;&gt; slist = list(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; slist
['m', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'm']
&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>
<p>That was easy! Now we can reverse that list,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; slist.reverse()
&gt;&gt;&gt; slist
['m', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'm']
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> </pre>
<p>build a string from it and compare that to the original string. (Note that
we can't just compare <code>slist</code> and the result of
<code>slist.reverse()</code> because <code>reverse</code> changes the list
<em>in place</em>, that is it changes <code>slist</code> itself rather than
creating a new string).</p>
<p>We build a string from a list using a joining string and the string method
<code>join</code>. Here's a general example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; iplist = ['199', '147', '23', '5']
&gt;&gt;&gt; ip = '.'.join(iplist)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ip
'199.147.23.5'
&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>
<p>In our case we want to join our characters without anything between them.
We can do that by using the empty string '' (that's two single quotes with
nothing between them) as our joining string,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s_reversed = ''.join(slist)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s_reversed
'madam'
&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>
<p>Putting all these pieces together we have,</p>
<pre><code class="python">s = <span class="string">"madam"</span>
slist = list(s)
slist.reverse()
s_reversed = <span class="string">''</span>.join(slist)
<span class="keyword">if</span> s == s_reversed:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"It is a palindrome!"</span>
<span class="keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"It is NOT a palindrome."</span></code></pre>
<h2>Refinements</h2>
<p>The original problem statement taunted us by saying that "An excellent
program would be able to deal with phrases by ignoring capitalization, spaces
and punctuation in the input, e.g. 'A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!' is a
palindromic phrase" and it would be nice if our code identified it as such.
The trick here is to preprocess the string before letting our code from above
at it. What we'll do is take the string and build a new one from it. As we
build the new one we will lowercase any capital letters, and exclude any
characters that are not alphabetic. The resulting code is,</p>
<pre><code class="python">s = <span class="string">"A man, a plan, a canal, panama."</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> s, <span class="string">"becomes..."</span>,
s_new = <span class="string">''</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> c <span class="keyword">in</span> s:
    <span class="keyword">if</span> c.isalpha():
        <span class="keyword">if</span> c.isupper():
            s_new = s_new + c.lower()
        <span class="keyword">else</span>:
            s_new = s_new + c
<span class="keyword">print</span> s_new</code></pre>
<p>and the output is,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
A man, a plan, a canal, panama. becomes... amanaplanacanalpanama
&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>
<p>If we place this code before either of our palindrome tests from above we
have a complete, and hopefully <em>excellent</em>, program.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>So far we have just used "madam" and been pleased when our code correctly
identified it as a palindrome, but that's not sufficient testing. What would
be good additional tests? Well madam is a palindrome with an odd number of letters,</p>
<ul>
  <li> but we should
    also test one with an even number of letters.</li>
  <li>In addition we should test non-palindromes with both odd,</li>
  <li>and even numbers of letters.</li>
  <li>We should also test "at the edges". This suggests we test some short
    strings, perhaps one letter</li>
  <li>and two letter strings. All one letter strings are palindromes but we
    should try both palindromic and non-palindromic two letter strings.</li>
  <li>And of course we should test a string with non-alphabetic characters in
    it.</li>
</ul>
<p>A good set of test values then would be:</p>
<pre><code>madam
maam
motor
moor
a
oo
at
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!</code></pre>
<p>Running our program multiple times to test all of these would be tiring so
it would be nice if we could automate it. We could do that by putting our
test values into a list and looping through it to run all the tests. Thus the
testing version of our program might look like this,</p>
<pre><code class="python">TESTS = [<span class="string">'madam'</span>, <span class="string">'maam'</span>, <span class="string">'motor'</span>, <span class="string">'moor'</span>, <span class="string">'a'</span>, <span class="string">'oo'</span>, <span class="string">'at'</span>,
         <span class="string">'A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!'</span>]
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">'Testing Solution 1:'</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> s <span class="keyword">in</span> TESTS:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> s,
    <span class="comment"># Preprocess s to lower case and remove non-alphas.</span>
    s_new = <span class="string">''</span>
    <span class="keyword">for</span> c <span class="keyword">in</span> s:
        <span class="keyword">if</span> c.isalpha():
            <span class="keyword">if</span> c.isupper():
                s_new = s_new + c.lower()
            <span class="keyword">else</span>:
                s_new = s_new + c
    s = s_new <span class="comment"># Replace s with s_new.</span>
    
    <span class="comment"># Test to see if s is a palindrome using Solution 1.</span>
    palindrome = True
    <span class="keyword">for</span> offset <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">0</span>, len(s)/<span class="number">2</span>):
        <span class="keyword">if</span> s[offset] != s[len(s)-<span class="number">1</span>-offset]:
           palindrome = False
    <span class="keyword">if</span> palindrome:
        <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"is a palindrome!"</span>
    <span class="keyword">else</span>:
        <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"is NOT a palindrome."</span></code></pre>
<p>This is an awkward way to test our code because we need to edit our
original program. Fortunately Python allows us to make our palindrome testing
code a stand alone function, and then to embed it into a module that does
automatic testing when run on its own, but from which we can import the
palindrome function if we need to use it. Creating such modules and functions
is the topic of the next course module.</p>
