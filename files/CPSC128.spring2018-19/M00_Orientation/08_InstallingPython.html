<h1>Installing Python</h1>
<p>Here are some brief guidelines for installing Python. They have been sufficient for most students to get it installed, but don't hesitate to let me know if you get stuck or are uncertain about how to proceed at some point in the process.</p>
<p><em>Version</em>: We will be using Python 2.x where x needs to be 4 or
greater. 2.7.9 is the newest version as of Jan 2015.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Do not install Python 3.x!</strong> Yes it is newer and improved,
but it is still <em>too new</em>. Many of the online resources you will find describe the
2.x series so that is what we will use. As python.org itself puts it,</p>
<blockquote><p>"...start with Python 2.7; more existing third party software is compatible with Python 2 than Python 3 right now."</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Windows users</em>: Go to the <a
href="http://www.python.org/download">Python download page</a> and select &quot;Python 2.7.9&quot;. This will download an MSI file that
you can then execute to install Python.</p>
<p><em>Macintosh users</em>: Python comes pre-installed on Mac OS X but may
not include a graphical development environment. Check the Python.org page <a
href="http://www.python.org/download/mac/">Python on the Mac</a> for more
information.</p>
<p><em>Linux users</em>: If you are using a Linux system you probably already
have Python installed. Check your menus and see. If you don't see an entry
for Python, try typing <code>which python</code> at a shell prompt. If you
get back a path, e.g. <code>/usr/bin/python</code>, it means Python is
installed and you're good to go. If not, use your package manager to install
Python 2.x. (If you don't know what your package manager is, or what a shell
prompt is, you might not be ready for Linux). </p>
<h2>Testing your installation</h2>
<p>You can run Python at an unadorned command line or in a more
helpful GUI (<strong>G</strong>raphical <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>I</strong>nterface) environment. The standard Python GUI is called IDLE, and is what
I will describe using throughout the course. (If you have some programming
experience or just like trying software out there are numerous other more
powerful Pyton IDEs you can explore. Let the Google guide you!)</p>
<p>If you run IDLE you will get a window that looks something like this
(allowing for OS and version differences, and probably larger&mdash;I scaled
it down a bit to keep the image compact),</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="../M01_Introduction/15_IDLE_Window.png" /></p>
<p>You can check that Python is working by typing a couple of commands. First
type: <code>print "Hello Python"</code> and then press the Enter key. Then
try typing: <code>print 2**16</code> and pressing Enter. If you see this,</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="08_IDLE_Test.png" /></p>
<p>it's working! And you've learned your first Python statement: <code>print</code>.</p>
<p>If you don't see that, get in touch, and we'll sort things out.</p>
