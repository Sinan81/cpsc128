<h1>What Language?</h1>
<h2>I've read the course description but I still don't know what language we
will be using.</h2>
<p>Careful readers will have noticed that the particular language the course
will use is not mentioned in the course description. This is by design,
not accident. Like fashions programming languages come and go but the
fundamentals change much more slowly. This course is decidedly about the
fundamentals, and hopefully the course description will outlast current
language fashions.</p>
<h2>No, really, what language will we be using?</h2>
<p>We'll be using the language <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.</p>
<h2>Why Python?</h2>
<p>Python was designed to be a teaching language. This means that concepts
can be introduced one at a time, and lots of messy details delayed until they
are needed.</p>
<p>Industrial-strength languages like Java and C++ are good for developing
huge software systems, after all that's what they were designed for, but they
are problematic as first languages. For instance in Java to write a very simple program, one that just displays the message "Hi" on the
screen, the code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>class myfirstjavaprog
{  
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
           System.out.println("Hi!");
        }
}</code></pre>
<p>and in C++ it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hi!\n";
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see in Java and C++ there are a lot of concepts that have to be
explained (e.g. in Java: <code>class</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, <code>void</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>arg[]</code>,
<code>System.out.println</code>) before one can write even a very simple program.</p>
<p>In Python the program is just:</p>
<pre><code>print "Hi!"</code></pre>
<p>which is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>If you're still not convinced think about learning to fly. Your goal might
be to fly 747s or F14s but you don't learn to fly on those planes because
they are too complicated, and too unforgiving of mistakes. You learn to fly
in a small Cessna. Once you have mastered the principles of flying you move
on and upwards. Interestingly the charms of Python are so seductive that some
programmers never leave it (it is for example one of only three internally
supported languages at Google).</p>
<p>(It's also free in both<a href="05_WhatLanguage.html#L107">*</a> senses and available across
most platforms.)</p>
<h2>And there's this...</h2>
<p class="img"><img src="../xkcd_on_python.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p><a name="L107" id="L107">*</a> "free as in beer" and "free as in speech"
see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre">Wikipedia</a>
or just Google "free as in beer".</p>
