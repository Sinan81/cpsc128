<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Trivialities</h3>
    <p>We only know enough Python commands to write simple programs so far,
    but we do need to practice using what we've got so ... write a program
    that produces sessions like this one:</p>
    <pre>Useless Trivia Generator v0.01
==============================
How old are you? 28
And how many pounds do you weigh? 165
Did you know that you're 196 in dog years!
But you're also over 883008000 seconds old.
Did you know that on the moon you would weigh only 27.5 pounds?
But on the sun, you'd weigh 4471.5 pounds (but not for long!).</pre>
    <p>Some facts that might be helpful to you in writing your program:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are seven dog years in each calendar year. </li>
      <li>There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours
        in a day, and (at least) 365 days in a year. </li>
      <li>Things weigh 1/6th as much on the moon as they do on the surface of
        the earth. </li>
      <li>Things weigh 27.1 times as much on the surface of the sun as they
        do on the surface of the earth. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Calculating Wind Chill</h3>
    <p>While the temperature tells us how cold the air outside is, we are
    often more interested in how quickly we will cool down. The rate at which
    we lose heat depends on the temperature outside, and also on the speed of
    the wind: the combined effect of temperature and wind speed is often
    called the wind chill. The effective
    temperature,<strong>T<sub>e</sub></strong>, can be calculated using the
    expression,</p>
    <p><img alt="." src="30_wind-chill.png" width="367" height="22" /></p>
    <p>where <strong>V</strong> is the wind speed in kilometres per hour, and
    <strong>T</strong> is the temperature in Celsius.</p>
    <p>Write a program that calculates the effective temperature. It should
    request the temperature and wind speed from the user and output the
    effective temperature.  </p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Converting from furlongs et al to feet</h3>
    <p>A historian has come across a large body of material using
    outdated units of measurement. Specifically, distance measurements are
    given in terms of feet, yards (1 yard = 3 feet), chains (1 chain = 22
    yards), and furlongs (1 furlong = 10 chains). Write a program that will
    let her enter one of the historical measurements in furlongs, chains,
    yards and feet (e.g. 2 furlongs, 3 chains, 13 yards and 2 feet) and
    output the equivalent measurement in feet (i.e. 1559 feet).</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Converting from feet to furlongs et al</h3>
    <p>The historian above now wishes to convert some measurements she has
    made in feet into these archaic units. Write a program that will convert
    from feet to furlongs, chains, yards and feet, so if she inputs 1559 the
    output should be something like:</p>
    <pre>1559 feet is equal to:
  2 furlongs,
  3 chains,
 13 yards, and
  2 feet.</pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the following naming scheme for your program files:
    <code>a</code><em>assignment#</em><code>p</code><em>problem#</em><code>v</code><em>version#</em><code>.py</code>
    . So your first attempt at problem 1 on this assignment will be named
    <code>a2p1v1.py</code> and your second attempt (should there be one) will
    be named <code>a2p1v2.py</code> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your assignment by emailing your python programs to me. I advise to submit early and submit often, since I will often review your programs as they are submitted and provide feedback that will let you improve them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
