<h1>Timing programs</h1>
<p>Once your code is working, and you have tested it to ensure it works
correctly, you may need to try and make it faster. Making it faster implies
being able to measure its speed. Just as you measure the speed of an athlete
by timing them when they run a race we measure the speed of a program by
timing how long it takes to execute. The simplest way to do this in Python is
using a program structured like this,</p>
<p><img alt="." src="TimingPrograms_1.py.png" width="286" height="128" /></p>
<p>The function <code>time.time()</code> returns the current time in seconds since the
epoch*. By grabbing the time before the computations begin in <code>start</code> and the
time when they are completed in <code>end</code>. and then finding their difference we can
calculate how long the computations took. Here is an example in which we see
how long it takes to find the sum of the square roots of the numbers from 1
to 1,000,000.</p>
<p><img alt="." src="TimingPrograms_2.py.png" width="286" height="157" /></p>
<p>Truly accurate timing of program execution is much trickier than this
technique suggests. Unless you get the help of the operating system the
timing shown above will depend on what else happens to be running on your
computer at the same time. More sophisticated timing is possible using
programs called profilers that measure the time more accurately than our
approach above.</p>
