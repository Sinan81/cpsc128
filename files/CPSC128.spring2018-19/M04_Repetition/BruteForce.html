<h1>Brute Force</h1>
<blockquote>
  <em><span>When in doubt, use brute force. ~ Ken Thompson, Bell
  Labs</span></em></blockquote>
<p>Thompson's advice has two aspects. The first is that some problems that
are difficult for humans to solve because we are not quick at processing and
are unreliable when doing repetitive operations are easy for computers to solve
because those weaknesses of ours are their strengths. In this sense he is
advising us to play to the computer's strengths.</p>
<p>The second sense is that often we try to be too clever when solving
problems and to overthink our solutions when simple brute force could get the
job done.</p>
<p>We'll look at a few types of problems in this module that lend themselves
to brute force solutions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first are simulations where we have the computer painstakingly
    model some process step-by-step, and do so not just once but many times
    so that we can estimate the likelihood of various outcomes.</li>
  <li>The second are in some sense purely computational problems that arise
    in numerical processing, e.g. in cryptography. We will begin just by
    searching for certain kinds of numbers. Since there may be a lot of
    numbers to consider and each one requires some computation this is well
    suited to repetitive computer processing.</li>
  <li>Long before sudoku, newspapers featured various mental puzzles, one type
    of which were known as cryptarithms. These can be solved by brute force,
    but there can be so many possible solutions to consider that refining our
    brute force approach is necessary.</li>
</ul>
