<h1>Cryptarithms</h1>
<p>Long before sudoku newspapers featured various mental puzzles, one type of
which were known as cryptarithms. Cryptarithms are arithmetic puzzles in
which some 'words' are added together to get a sum,</p>
<pre>   send
 + more
--------
  money</pre>
<p>Each letter stands for a distinct digit, i.e. no two letters stand for the
same digit, and the numbers are well-formed, e.g. they do not begin with
zero.</p>
<p>How can we use the computer to help us in solving cryptarithms? So far our
approach to programming has been to do the problem by hand, and to watch
ourselves carefully as we do so. Our goal in doing the problem by hand has
been to identify the algorithm we are using, so we can translate it into
Python and have the computer do it for us. The assumption has been that the
computer will do it in the same way we have.</p>
<p>Cryptarithms are an exception to that approach, because solving a
cryptarithm by hand relies on the unique features of the particular
cryptarithm we are given. For example in the cryptarithm above we know that m
must represent the digit 1. (Why? Because s and m no matter how large cannot
add to more than 17, 18 with a carry from the previous addition, and since m
cannot be 0, it must be 1.)</p>
<p>But there is no easy way to translate the procedures we carry out in doing
cryptarithms by hand into general computational procedures. Instead, we will
rely on the particular strengths of computers to have the computer
solve the problem in a way we would not do it ourselves.</p>
<p>Unlike humans, computers have the ability to do monotonous calculations
rapidly and accurately. This suggests using the computer to solve the
cryptarithm by trial and error. We will have the computer find the solution
by checking all possible solutions until it finds one that works. The only
trick is to come up with a procedure that guarantees we will not miss any
possible solutions.</p>
<p>The key is to use nested loops to iterate through all possible values of
the letters, i.e. s, e, n, d, m, o , r, and y. The loops to do so look like
this:</p>
<p><img alt="." src="SendMoreMoney_1.py.png" width="349" height="115" /></p>
<p>Note that the loops for s and m begin at 1 because these letters cannot
take the value 0 (due to the well-formedness criterion above).</p>
<p>Inside all these loops we place statements to 'build' the values of send,
more and money, and test to see if send+more=money,</p>
<p><img alt="." src="SendMoreMoney_2.py.png" width="310" height="56" /></p>
<p>(Note the use of == here where in paragraph form we have written
send+more=money, and always remember, "Assignment is not equality".)</p>
<p>If the test-expression is true we are still not quite done. We must check
that no two letters represent the same digit. That requires a second, even
longer, <code>if</code>,</p>
<p><img alt="." src="SendMoreMoney_3.py.png" width="474" height="100" /></p>
<p>(Note the triangular shape of the comparisons. It results because having
compared s to e in the first line of comparisons, we do not have to compare e
to s in the second line, and so on.</p>
<p>If this <code>if</code> also succeeds, then we know we have a solution and should
display it,</p>
<p><img alt="." src="SendMoreMoney_4.py.png" width="297" height="57" /></p>
<p>Putting it all together we get:</p>
<p><img alt="." src="SendMoreMoney.py.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>Assuming I have not made any typos this code works, but it is slooooow!
How slow? Try it and see. How many solutions to this cryptarithm are there?
Some cryptarithms have no solutions, some have 1, but many have several.</p>
<p>Now about that slowness issue. The core problem is that the statements
inside the innermost loop are each executed ~200,000,000 times each (that's
two hundred million!). We calculate that amount by multiplying the numbers of
times the loops outside it go around: 10 times for s by 11 times for e by 11
times for n and so on, or 10x11x11x11x10x11x11x11 = 177,156,100. To speed up
the program we need to move statements outward from the center of the program
where possible so they will be executed fewer times.</p>
<p>For example we don't need to wait until we are in the centre of the loops
to check that s and e have different values. We could place an <code>if</code> test to do
that right after the <code>for</code> loop generating values of e. Each time we detect a
duplicate and skip the interior loops we save 1.6 million iterations. In fact
most of the <code>if</code> tests can be distributed outwards.</p>
<p>Similarly we don't have to wait until we are in the center to check the
sum of send and more. We could check partial sums before we get to the
middle, e.g. we could check that y = d + e early on if we rearranged the order
of the loops and avoid many more iterations.</p>
<p>For the ultimate speedup we could be less brutish and instead of trying
ALL possible combinations we could generate some values and then calculate
others. For example if you know that d = 5 and e = 2 then you know that y has
to be 7. Note that this gets a little tricky when d+e is greater than 10
because you have a carry digit to worry about.</p>
<p>Combining all these tricks can make a large cryptarithm program run
millions of times faster.</p>
