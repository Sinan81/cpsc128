<h1>More Armstrong Numbers</h1>
<p>Recall from the previous assignment that "An Armstrong number is an
  <em>n</em>-digit number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the <em>n</em>th
power. For example 153 equals 1<sup>3</sup>+5<sup>3</sup>+3<sup>3</sup>, so
it is an Armstrong number." On that assignment you wrote a program to
determine if a given number was an Armstrong number. Now we'd like to write a
program that displays all the 3-digit Armstrong numbers.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>Our general approach will be to test each 3-digit number, that is every
number from 100 to 999, to see if it is an Armstrong number. If it is we'll
display it, and if it isn't we'll just move on to the next number.</p>
<p>This can be expressed in pseudocode as,</p>
<pre>for each number from 100 to 999
    if it is an Armstrong number
        display it</pre>
<p>You should have some Armstrong number detecting code from Assignment 3
that looks something like this,</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="isArmstrong.py.png" width="467" height="156"
/> </p>
<p>All we need to do is to remove the I/O (input and output) from this code
and place the remainder inside a loop. Doing so gives us this using a while
loop,</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="ArmstrongNumbers_while.py.png" width="336" height="145"
/></p>
<p>or this using a for loop,</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="ArmstrongNumbers_for.py.png" width="338" height="127"
/></p>
<p>This program can be structured differently to avoid having to take apart
the number in each loop iteration. The key to the restructuring is to use
three nested loops. Each loop generates one of the three digits. Since the
innermost loop iterates fastest, and the outer loop slowest the result is to
check every combination of the three digits. (Try inserting a print inside
the innermost loop to verify this). The resulting program might look like
this,</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="ArmstrongNumbers_nested.py.png" width="336" height="101"
/></p>
<p>Note that instead of breaking apart the number, this time we have to build
it up for testing and displaying, so while this is a different approach it is
not a markedly better one. It is a good reminder though that even very short
and simple programs can often be written in many ways and that unless you
have considered several ways you may be missing a better way.</p>
