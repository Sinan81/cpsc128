<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>More weird numbers</h3>
    <p>"Take a four-digit number. Add the number formed by the first two
    digits to the number formed by the last two digits, and square the
    resulting sum. Surprise! You've got the original number back."</p>
    <p>Write a program to find all the four-digit numbers that have this
    property.</p>
    <p>For example, here's a number that fails the test: 1430. Add 14 to 30
    to get 44, square 44 to get 1936, but this is not what we started with
    (i.e. 1430) so this number fails the test. </p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Drawing Diamonds</h3>
    <p>Write a program that displays a diamond on the screen, e.g.</p>
    <pre>  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *</pre>
    <p>Your program should ask the user how large a diamond to draw and what
    character to use to draw it. (The size of a diamond is specified by the
    lengths of its sides, i.e. 3 in the case above).</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>DONALD + GERALD = ROBERT</h3>
    <p>Write a program that displays the solution(s) to the cryptarithm:</p>
    <pre>  DONALD
+ GERALD
--------
  ROBERT</pre>
    <p>Each letter represents one digit. No two letters represent the same
    digit. The numbers represented by DONALD, GERALD and ROBERT are
    well-formed, e.g. do not begin with 0. How fast can you make your
    program? The faster the better (but since someone once tried it let me
    say that presolving it and just the printing the solution is definitely a
    cheat!).</p>
    <p>Include <a
    href="TimingPrograms.html">timing
    code</a> in your program so I can compare its speed to others on my
    computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Craps</h3>
    <p>Write a program that outputs the probability of winning at the game of
    craps. The rules for the game of craps are:</p>
    <blockquote><p>
      A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces. These faces contain 1,
      2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 spots. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of
      the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11
      on the first throw, the player wins. If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the
      first throw (called "craps"), the player loses (i.e. the "house" wins).
      If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw, then that sum
      becomes the player's "point". To win, you must continue rolling the
      dice until you "make your point". The player loses by rolling a 7
      before making the point.</p></blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the following naming scheme for your program files:
    <code>a</code><em>assignment#</em><code>p</code><em>problem#</em><code>v</code><em>version#</em><code>.py</code>
    . So your first attempt at problem 1 on this assignment will be named
    <code>a4p1v1.py</code> and your second attempt (should there be one) will
    be named <code>a4p1v2.py</code> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your assignment by emailing your python programs to me. I advise to submit early and submit often, since I will often review your programs as they are submitted and provide feedback that will let you improve them.</p>
  </li>
