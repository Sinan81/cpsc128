<h1>Week 2 Overview</h1>
<p>The goals for the week are for you to become comfortable writing SIPO
style programs using Python, and to get some practice in moving from a
problem described in English, through a solution procedure described using English to one
expressed in Python.</p>
<p>I believe the materials are sufficient to prepare you to do the
assignment, but I may have left things out or been unclear (not on purpose
mind you!). Feel free to ask questions in the Discussion Forum.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong><sub>1</sub>: You may find it helpful to
<em>begin</em> by looking at the assignment. Then as you read the other pages
you will have a sense of how you might use the techniques being described.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong><sub>2</sub>: If you look at the assignment and
believe you can do it, it is still worth skimming the other pages in case
they mention techniques you might not think of on your own, and to know all
the elements that should be present in a complete program.</p>
