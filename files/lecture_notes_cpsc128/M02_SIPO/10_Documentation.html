<h1>Documentation </h1>
<p>The final step in producing a complete program is to document our program.
For a large project documentation includes in-program comments explaining the code,
various charts showing the program structure, a user manual, etc. However for
now we will constrain ourselves to in-program comments. </p>
<p>Two types of comments are usually included: meta-comments, and internal
comments. Meta-comments document who created the program, and when and why
they did so. Internal comments on the other hand are used to document the
internal workings of the program. As a rule of thumb you should comment any
statements that you had to puzzle over to figure out, on the assumption that
when you reencounter them in six months you will again have to puzzle them
out. </p>
<p>Both types of comments are produced by the same simple mechanism: the
computer ignores any text on a line that follows a hash mark outside of a
string literal, i.e. a <code>#</code>. Thus a <code>#</code> at the start of
a line instructs the computer to ignore the entire line, and a <code>#</code>
part way along a line instructs the computer to ignore the remainder of the
line. (Fine print: unless the <code>#</code> is enclosed in a string
literal.) </p>
<p>Our first program is short and straightforward enough to get by without
internal comments (the variable names are descriptive, and the output
statements make clear what the program is intended to do). So we will simply
add a small banner of meta-information at the top. The result is our first
complete Python program.</p>
<pre><code># f2c.py -- converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to its equivalent in Celsius.
# CPSC 128 Example program
# Tim Topper, Winter 2013

print "This program converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius."
print "Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit (e.g. 10) and press Enter."
temp_in_f = input("Temperature in Fahrenheit: ")

temp_in_c = (temp_in_f - 32) * 5 / 9

print temp_in_f, "degrees Fahrenheit =", temp_in_c, "degrees
Celsius."</code></pre>
