<h1>Version 3</h1>
<p>What are the unnecessary tests in Version 2? This time it's not
unnecessary tests being evaluated, it's unnecessary comparisons being
performed inside the tests.</p>
<p>Consider. The first <code>if</code> statement checks to see if
<code>grade</code> is between 95 and 100, so if the first <code>elif</code>
statement is reached we know the value is less than or equal to 94, or we
wouldn't have arrived here (unless the value is over 100, a condition we'll
deal with in a moment). Likewise, when we reach the second <code>elif</code>,
we no longer have to test that the value is less than or equal to 85, because
if it wasn't, it would have passed one of the previous tests. The
qualification in each case is: <em>as long as the value isn't over 100</em>.
This suggests that we can eliminate more than half the relational tests, as
long as we first test to make sure the value is between 0 and 100. The result
would be code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="comment"># Version 3.</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">" ... "</span> <span class="comment"># Instructions to user</span>
grade = input(<span class="string">"..."</span>)
<span class="keyword">if</span> grade &gt; <span class="number">100</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> grade &lt; <span class="number">0</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Error: The grade must be between 0 and 100."</span>
<span class="keyword">elif</span> grade &gt;= <span class="number">95</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"A+"</span>
<span class="keyword">elif</span> grade &gt;= <span class="number">86</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"A"</span>
<span class="keyword">elif</span> grade &gt;= <span class="number">80</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"A-"</span>
<span class="comment"># ...</span>
<span class="comment"># and so on down to</span>
<span class="comment"># ...</span>
<span class="keyword">elif</span> grade &gt;= <span class="number">50</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"D"</span>
<span class="keyword">elif</span> grade &gt;= <span class="number">0</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"F"</span></code></pre>
<p>(Again verify that the code works by "running it' in your mind with a
couple of typical values.)</p>
<p>This code represents a significant improvement over the second version on
two counts: it is more efficient, and it is easier to read. It is easier to
read because the relational expressions are shorter. It is more efficient
because where the previous version had 33 relational operators (3 for each of 11 letter
grades) this one has 3 + 10 = 13 (2 for the initial range check followed by
one for each possible letter grade except the last). This is less than half
as many, a significant improvement in any field (imagine a runner completing
a race in half the previous time, or a car whose mileage suddenly
doubled!).</p>
