<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Is it a triangle?</h3>
    <p>Write a program that accepts three numerical values and outputs a
    message indicating whether they could represent the lengths of the sides of
    a triangle or not. (Note: Not necessarily a right-angled triangle, just any triangle at all.)</p>
    <p>A sample run might look like this,</p>
    <pre>=================
Is it a triangle?
-----------------
Enter your first value: 4
Enter the second value: 9
Enter the third value: 3
I'm afraid those three numbers could NOT represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle.</pre>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Is it an Armstrong number?</h3>
    <p>An Armstrong number is an <em>n</em>-digit number that is equal to the
    sum of its digits each raised to the <em>n</em>th power. For example 153
    equals 1<sup>3</sup>+5<sup>3</sup>+3<sup>3</sup>, so it is an Armstrong
    number. Write a program that inputs a three-digit number, and outputs a
    message saying whether it is an Armstrong number or not.</p>
    <p>A sample run might look like this,</p>
    <pre>==========================
Is it an Armstrong number?
--------------------------
Enter your number: 284
I'm afraid 284 is NOT an Armstrong number.</pre>
    <p><em>Hint</em>: You can pull apart a number to get its individual digits
    by dividing and modulo-ing by appropriate multiples of 10, e.g. num %10
    will give you the 1s digit, i.e. the rightmost digit, and num/100 will give
    you the 100s digit, i.e. the leftmost digit.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Richter Scale</h3>
    <p>Write a program that inputs the Richter magnitude of an earthquake and
    outputs the corresponding description and typical effects according to the
    table* below.</p>
    <table class="dark">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Richter<br />
            Magnitudes</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th style="text-align: left;">Earthquake Effects</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Less than 2.0</td>
          <td>Micro</td>
          <td>Microearthquakes, not felt.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2.0-2.9</td>
          <td rowspan="2">Minor</td>

          <td>Often felt, but rarely causes damage.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4.0-4.9</td>
          <td>Light</td>
          <td>Noticeable shaking of indoor items, rattling noises. Significant
            damage unlikely.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5.0-5.9</td>
          <td>Moderate</td>
          <td>Can cause major damage to poorly constructed buildings over small
            regions. At most slight damage to well-designed buildings. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>6.0-6.9</td>
          <td>Strong</td>
          <td>Can be destructive in areas up to about 160 kilometres (100 mi)
            across in populated areas.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>7.0-7.9</td>
          <td>Major</td>
          <td>Can cause serious damage over larger areas.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8.0-8.9</td>
          <td rowspan="2">Great</td>
          <td>Can cause serious damage in areas several hundred miles
          across.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>9.0-9.9</td>
          <td>Devastating in areas several thousand miles across.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>10.0+</td>
          <td>Epic</td>
          <td>Never recorded; see below for equivalent seismic energy
          yield.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>A sample run might look like this,</p>
    <pre>======================
Earthquake Interpreter
----------------------
Enter the Richter magnitude of the earthquake: 4.4
Magnitude: 4.4
Description: Light.
Effects: Noticeable shaking of indoor items, rattling noises. 
Significant damage unlikely.</pre>

  <li><h3>Choosing a Valentine's gift</h3>
    <p>The graphic below** provides a flowchart for choosing a valentine's day
    gift. Write a program that implements it. (Click the image to see a full-size version).</p>
    <p class="img"><a href="23_ValentinesGiftFlowchart.jpg"><img
    src="23_ValentinesGiftFlowchart.jpg"
    width="90%" /></a></p>
    <p>A sample run might look like this,</p>
    <pre>======================================
Find Your Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
--------------------------------------
Is your valentine male (M) or female (F)? F
What's your budget (in Dh)? 800
Will you see her on the day:
    1. No I'm/she's out of the country at the moment.
    2. Yes, of course.
1 or 2? 2
I suggest a romantic dinner. Many restaurants have special dining deals
on Valentine's day.
    </pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>You may take liberties as I have and simplify the lengthy text of the
recommendations that are offered.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: Remember to use <code>raw_input</code> instead of
<code>input</code> to read string values.</p>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the following naming scheme for your program files:
    <code>a</code><em>assignment#</em><code>p</code><em>problem#</em><code>v</code><em>version#</em><code>.py</code>
    . So your first attempt at problem 1 on this assignment will be named
    <code>a3p1v1.py</code> and your second attempt (should there be one) will
    be named <code>a3p1v2.py</code> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your assignment by emailing your python programs to me. I advise to submit early and submit often, since I will often review your programs as they are submitted and provide feedback that will let you improve them.</p>
  </li>
