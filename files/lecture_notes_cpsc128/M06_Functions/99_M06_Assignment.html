  <li><p>Insert the necessary function definitions into the code below so
    that it will work properly (i.e. as shown in the sample runs below
    it).</p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> 0 is a
        one-digit, even, unsigned number.</li>
      <li>You may not make any changes to the code below, i.e. your functions

Function practice
------------------------------------------------------------
Give me an integer value: 78931
Your number contains 5 digits, is odd and is positive.
------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
    <pre>============================================================
Function practice
------------------------------------------------------------
Give me an integer value: -122
Your number contains 3 digits, is even but is not positive.
------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
    <p><strong>Hint</strong>: There are several ways of tackling the
    <code>ndigits</code> function.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can find the number of digits by counting how many times you
        can divide a number by 10 before you get 0, e.g. 7 can be divided by
        10 once, while 732 can be divided 3 times.</li>
      <li>You can use the logarithm of the number to the base 10.</li>
      <li>You can convert the number to a string and then use
        <strong>len()</strong> to see how long the string is.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The next three problems all involve writing functions to determine if a
list of card numbers represents a straight. A straight is a hand in which the
cards' face values form a sequence, e.g. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 6, 4, 7, 3, 5 are
both straights (even though the numbers in the second case are not in order),
but 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 4, 5, 6, 5, 7 are not (the first, because 6 is missing,
and the second because of the duplicate 5s). Note that the cards do not have
to be in the same suit, e.g. the hand containing 2&clubs;, 3&diams;,
4&clubs;, 5&spades; and 6&hearts; is a straight.</p>
<p>There are numerous computational approaches that can be taken to decide if
a list of card numbers is a straight or not. Each of the following problems
describes one of them and provides pseudocode for it. <strong>Your job is to
translate each pseudocode description into a Python function</strong>.</p>
<p>(Hint: You will notice that all three approaches contain the operation
"replace the card numbers in the copy with numbers representing their face
values". To avoid rewriting, that would make a good function, no?)</p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>One approach to seeing if the cards in the list are a straight is to
    sort them in ascending order and then see if each one is one larger than
    the previous one. That is we take 6, 4, 7, 3, 5 and sort it to get 3, 4,
    5 ,6, 7, and then we make sure the second entry (4) is one larger than
    the first (3), and that the third entry (5) is one larger than the second
    (4), and so on. If they all are it's a straight, but if we find
    neighbouring values that are the same, or that are more than 1 apart it's
    not a straight. Pseudocode: 
    <pre><code>def isStraight(hand):
    '''Return True if the cards in hand are a straight, and False otherwise.'''
    make a copy of hand (so we don't change it) and work with the copy from now on
    replace the card numbers in the copy with numbers representing their face values
        (e.g. 1 for Ace, 2 for Two, ... and 13 for King)
    sort the copy in ascending numerical order
    <em>Check that each value is one larger than the previous value:</em>
    assume the cards are a straight by setting a flag to True
    for each value in the copy starting with the second value and going to the last value
        if this value if not one greater than the previous value
            set the flag to False
    if the flag is still True
        it's a straight
    otherwise
        it's not</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Our second approach begins the same way as the first, i.e. by replacing
    card numbers by face values and sorting them, but then we compare the
    sorted list to a test list with the same starting value. What test list?
    Suppose I tell you I have a five card straight starting from a face value
    of 3. You could say "Oh you have a 3, a 4, a 5, a 6 and a 7." The idea
    here is to build the necessary test list and compare it to the actual
    list and to see if they match. If they do it's a straight, otherwise it's
    not. Pseudocode: 
    <pre><code>def isStraight(hand):
    '''Return True if the cards in hand are a straight, and False otherwise.'''
    make a copy of hand (so we don't change it) and work with the copy from now on
    replace the card numbers in the copy with numbers representing their face values
        (e.g. 1 for Ace, 2 for Two, ... and 13 for King)
    sort the copy in ascending numerical order
    find the minimum face value in the list
    build a new list containing the values a straight starting with that 
        minimum value would contain, i.e. a list of consecutive numbers
        starting with the min value and having the same number of values
        in it as the hand, e.g. min value = 3 and hand size = 5 implies a 
        test list of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
        (Hint: Use the range command to build the test list.)
    if the test list equals the sorted copy
        it's a straight
    else
        it's not</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Our final approach is based on the observation that the cards in a
    straight must all be different, and that the first and last cards' face
    values will differ by the length of the hand minus 1, e.g. in a five card
    hand the face value of the last card will be 5 minus 1 or 4 greater than
    the first card (as it is for example in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] where 7 is 4
    greater than 3). Of course the hand [3, 3, 5, 7, 7] also has the right
    range of values but isn't a straight because the face values in it are
    not unique (see the first condition in the first sentence above "the
    cards in a straight must all be different"). Which leads to the second
    test in the pseudocode below: 
    <pre><code>def isStraight(hand):
    '''Return True if the cards in hand are a straight, and False otherwise.'''
    make a copy of hand (so we don't change it) and work with the copy from now on
    replace the card numbers in the copy with numbers representing their face values
    find the minimum face value (Hint: Use the min function.)
    find the maximum face value (Hint: Can't you guess?)
    # If the largest and smallest values are the right distance apart
    # e.g. in a five card hand they 4 apart
    if max - min equals length of the list - 1 then
        # and all the values in the list are different
        # i.e. they all occur exactly once
        set the counter of unique values to 0
        for each value in the list
            if the number of times it ocurs in the list is 1
                (Hint: Use the count method.)
                add one to the counter of unique values
        if the count of unique values equals the length of the list
            it's a straight
        otherwise
            it's not
     else
         it's not a straight</code></pre>
