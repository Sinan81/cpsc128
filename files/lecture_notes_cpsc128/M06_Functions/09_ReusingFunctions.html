<h1>Reusing Functions</h1>
<p>Now that we've written some reusable functions dealing with playing cards
the question arises as to just how we go about reusing them.</p>
<p>One way to reuse them would be to open the program file containing them
and copy and paste the functions (and the constants <code>SUITS</code> and <code>FACE_VALUES</code>)
into our working program file. But what if we later improve these functions?
Then we'd have to recopy and repaste them. The same would apply if (God
forbid!) we found a bug that we had to fix in one of these functions. Then
we'd have to remember all the programs into which we'd copied and pasted them
and replace the buggy versions with the new ones. It would be nice if that
copying and pasting could be automated somehow so that code always benefited
automatically from improvements to our functions.</p>
<p>Well it turns out that automatically copying and pasting code is tricky
and thus unreliable. Instead programmers have found the best way to reuse
code is to have a way to include the contents (all or just some) of one file
in another. Python does this using modules and the <code>import</code>
command. We have already used <code>import</code> to get at functions in the
<code>math</code> and <code>random</code> modules. Now we will see how to use
it to get at functions we have written in our own programs.</p>
