<h1>Writing functions: is_even()</h1>
<p>We've used several of Python's built-in functions, but how do we write our
own? This is most easily shown by example, so to be concrete let's suppose we
want a function that tells us if a number is even.</p>
<p>It's usually easiest to write a function by starting with how you want to
use it. Let's say we are working on a game and wish we could write,</p>
<pre><code class="python">num = random.randint(<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">100</span>)
<span class="keyword">if</span> is_even(num):
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Good news your magic number is even! 10 bonus points for you."</span>
<span class="keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Bad news, your magic number is odd."</span></code></pre>
<p>The good thing about specifying the use of our function before writing it
is that we now know,</p>
<ul>
  <li>what the <em>name</em> of the function should be: <code>is_even</code>,</li>
  <li>that it will take one <em>parameter</em>, <code>num</code> in our case,</li>
  <li>that it <em>returns</em> a Boolean value, i.e. either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> value.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we know its name, parameter and return type, and we know from previous experience how
to implement its core functionality:</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="keyword">if</span> n%<span class="number">2</span> == <span class="number">0</span>:
    <span class="comment"># It's even</span>
<span class="keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="comment"># It's odd</span></code></pre>
<p> All we need now is to tie these things
  together with the necessary syntax like this,</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="keyword">import</span> random

<span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">is_even</span><span class="params">(n)</span>:</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> n%<span class="number">2</span> == <span class="number">0</span>:
        <span class="keyword">return</span> True
    <span class="keyword">else</span>:
        <span class="keyword">return</span> False
        
num = random.randint(<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">100</span>)

<span class="keyword">if</span> is_even(num):
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Good news your magic number is even! 10 bonus points for you."</span>
<span class="keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">"Bad news, your magic number is odd."</span></code></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The keyword <code>def</code> marks the begining of a function
    definition. It is followed by the name of the function, the parameter
    list enclosed in parentheses, and a colon.</li>
  <li>The code to be executed when the function is called is indented after
    the definition line.</li>
  <li>The <code>return</code> statement terminates the execution of the
    function as soon as it is executed and returns the specified value
    (either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> above). As you can see
    above a single function may have more than one return statement.</li>
  <li>The names of the parameter in the program and in the function do not
    need to be the same. <code>num</code> in the program is referred to as <code>n</code> in the function.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may wonder looking at the code above what we have gained. After all we
have removed <code>num%2 == 0</code> from an <code>if</code> test and
replaced it with 5 lines of code &mdash; this hardly seems simpler! What you
can't see in the example above (but will a few examples in the future) is
that this new function can be reused easily in other programs.</p>
<p>This speaks to why the names of the parameter do not need to be the same
in the function and the program &mdash; if they did the function could not be
easily reused! Imagine if the built-in square root function could only be
used if the variable it was passed was named <code>x</code>. That's not very
reusable.</p>
<p>Instead the name in the function definition line is <em>aliased</em> to
the value named in the call to the function. We can picture memory looking
like this before the function is called,</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="is_even_1.png" width="169" height="24" /></p>
<p>Like this while the function is executing (see how <code>n</code> the name
of the parameter in the function is an alias for the value of
<code>num</code> the name of 48 in the program?),</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="is_even_2.png" width="169" height="58" /></p>
<p>And like this again after the function has terminated,</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="is_even_1.png" width="169" height="24" /></p>
<p>Note that the value of <code>num</code> was not changed by the function
and this is as it should be. We don't want a function that decides if a
number is even to change the number in the course of deciding.</p>
<p>Note also that functions do not leave any lasting trace in memory. When
the function terminates any memory it has been using is freed and returned to
the system. This can lead to a third benefit of functions. In some types of
programs they reduce memory consumption because memory is only allocated
while it is needed, whereas normal variables exist for the entire run of the
program (or at least from the time they are created until the end of the
program).</p>
