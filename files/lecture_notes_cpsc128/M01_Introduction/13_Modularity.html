<h1>Bonus Operation: Modularity</h1>
<p>The six commands we have seen so far are logically sufficient to write any
program. But in pragmatic terms another is required. As programs become large
it becomes more and more difficult to work on them, because there are too
many interconnected parts to think about at once. What's needed is a way to
break a large program up into smaller pieces, each of which can be developed
in isolation of the others. These small pieces are generically called modules. As a rough
guide, many programmers believe that no module should be more than a page
long, i.e. about 50 lines. Beyond a page it becomes too hard to think about,
and more errors are made. </p>
<p>(Aside. How large can programs get? Thousands of lines is typical.
Hundreds of thousands and millions is common. Windows NT 5.0 for example was
rumoured to consist of 50,000,000 lines of code, and in 2011 the Linux kernel contained around 15,000,000 lines of code.) </p>
<p>In Python, modularization is enabled by using functions (via the
<code>def</code> statement), classes (via the <code>class</code> statement)
and modules (each Python program file is a module). </p>
