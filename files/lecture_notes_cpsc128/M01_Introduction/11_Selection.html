<h1>Operation #5: Selection</h1>
<p>SIPO style programming is not enough for all situations because there are
many areas in which the processing to be done depends on the input, e.g.</p>
<ul>
  <li>the tax you pay <em>depends</em> on how much you earn</li>
  <li>the grade you receive <em>depends</em> on the quality of your work</li>
  <li>the formula to calculate the area of a figure <em>depends</em> on its
    shape</li>
  <li>the amount of leave an employee accumulates <em>depends</em> on their
    employment status</li>
</ul>
<p>To accommodate such situations we need the ability to process data
selectively. Imperative/procedural programming languages (like Python)
achieve this by using selection statements. To handle the cases above we test
something (your earnings, your work quality, the shape of the figure, or
someone's employment status) to determine how processing should proceed. The
result of the test is used to select the processing to carry out.</p>
<p>The most common selection command is the <code>if</code> statement. In
Python the basic <code>if</code> statement looks like this (we'll see some
variations next week), </p>
  <pre><code><b>if</b> <i>test</i> :
    <i>statements to do if the test is true</i>
<b>else</b>:
    <i>statements to do if the test is false</i></code></pre>
<p>The <code><i>test</i></code> evaluates some condition, e.g. that the input
is  less than 100. If it is (that is, if the test is true), the first
group of statements are executed, and the second group of statements (after
<code>else</code>) are skipped. If the test is not true, then the first group
of statements is skipped, and the second group of statements are executed. In
either case only one of the two groups of statements is executed. Thus the
<code>if</code> statement selects which group of statements to execute
<em>depending</em> on the outcome of the test.</p>
<p>This can be presented diagramatically by a flowchart like this: </p>
