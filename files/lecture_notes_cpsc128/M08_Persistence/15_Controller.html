<h1>A controller for our database</h1>
<p>"Wait a minute! What database?" Is that your first thought? Because it
would be a fair one if you hadn't noticed that once we have a persistent
dictionary-like storage, e.g. a shelve, we have a database. And if we have a
database we need some way to control it. Control what exactly? The actions
that get performed on that database. Those actions are most easily recalled
by remembering the acronym CRUD,</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>C</strong>reate: We need a way to create a new entry in the
    database.</li>
  <li><strong>R</strong>etrieve: We need to be able to retrieve an entry in
    the database.</li>
  <li><strong>U</strong>pdate: We need a way to update an existing entry in
    the database.</li>
  <li><strong>D</strong>elete: We need a way to delete an entry in the
    database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are really the only things we can do with a database, though the
retrieve operation is a little slippery because it's unclear what it means.
Does it refer just to accessing an entry whose key you know, or does it also
include finding entries that match certain criteria? Because the latter operation,
searching, is a very complicated task (basically it's the problem Google is
being rewarded for "solving").</p>
<p>What we'll do here is to build a little controller<sup>*</sup> that will let us work
on our database of quotations. The pseudocode for most controllers is
similar<sup>**</sup>,</p>
<pre><code>Forever
    Display the possible actions
    Get the user's choice of action
    Execute the code corresponding to the chosen action</code></pre>
<p>The Python code for CRUD operations on a shelve of quotes could look
like,</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="comment"># crud_controller.py</span>
<span class="keyword">import</span> shelve
fname = raw_input(<span class="string">'What file of quotes would you like to work with? '</span>)
db = shelve.open(fname)

<span class="comment"># Forever</span>
over = False
<span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> over:

    <span class="comment"># Display the possible actions</span>
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">'''
    Actions
    -------
    c - create a quote to add to the collection
    r - retrieve a quote from the collection and display it
    u - update a quote in the collection
    d - delete a quote from the collection
    l - list all the items in the collection
    q - exit
    Your choice?'''</span>

    <span class="comment"># Get the user's choice of action</span>
    choice = raw_input()
    
    <span class="comment"># Execute the code corresponding to the chosen action</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> choice == <span class="string">'c'</span>:
        <span class="keyword">pass</span>       
    <span class="keyword">elif</span> choice == <span class="string">'r'</span>:
        <span class="keyword">pass</span>   
    <span class="keyword">elif</span> choice == <span class="string">'u'</span>:
        <span class="keyword">pass</span>   
    <span class="keyword">elif</span> choice == <span class="string">'d'</span>:
        <span class="keyword">pass</span>  
    <span class="keyword">elif</span> choice == <span class="string">'l'</span>:
        <span class="keyword">pass</span>            
    <span class="keyword">elif</span> choice == <span class="string">'q'</span>:
        over = True       
    <span class="keyword">else</span>:
        <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">'Not a valid choice!'</span>
        
db.close()</code></pre>
<p>The code is a fairly straightforward translation of the pseudocode:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Forever loop is implemented with a quit option.</li>
  <li>The possible actions are displayed using a triple quoted string to
    display a menu of choices.</li>
  <li>We get the user's choice via a call to <code>raw_input</code>.</li>
  <li>We choose the appropriate action using an <code>if-elif-else</code>
    cascade.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>pass</code> statements are new, but they do nothing. Truly. If
they do nothing why have them? Because you can't have nothing between an
<code>if</code> and an <code>elif</code> or between a pair of
<code>elif</code>s,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; if x &gt; 5:
elif x == 5:
  File "&lt;pyshell#59&gt;", line 2
    elif x == 5:
       ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> </pre>
<p>The job of a <code>pass</code> statement is to have a statement somewhere
you don't want one by 1) being a statement, but 2) doing nothing. Most
languages provide a "do nothing" statement. They were originally included
because sometimes the structure that is otherwise the natural choice would
have a blank where a statement is required. The solution: create a do nothing
statement to avoid having a blank slot. They are used most commonly now
during program construction as I have done above. They serve as temporary
stand-ins when you are writing a program from the top-down or outside-in, i.e.
from the general to the specific, because you can write the overall framework
and put these dummy statements in as placeholders until you are ready to
write more detailed code.</p>
<p>Here's another version with a couple of the actions filled in,</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="comment"># crud_controller.py</span>
<span class="keyword">import</span> shelve
fname = raw_input(<span class="string">'What file of quotes would you like to work with? '</span>)
db = shelve.open(fname)
over = False
<span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> over:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">'''
    Actions
    -------
    c - create a quote to add to the collection
    r - retrieve a quote from the collection and display it
    u - update a quote in the collection
    d - delete a quote from the collection
    l - list all the items in the collection
    q - exit
    Your choice?'''</span>
    choice = raw_input()
    
    <span class="keyword">if</span> choice == <span class="string">'c'</span>:
        author = raw_input(<span class="string">'Who is the author of the quote? '</span>)
        text = raw_input(<span class="string">'What did they say or write? '</span>)
        lastname = author[author.rfind(<span class="string">' '</span>)+<span class="number">1</span>:]
        db[lastname] = [author, text]
        
    <span class="keyword">elif</span> choice == <span class="string">'r'</span>:
        <span class="keyword">pass</span>
    
    <span class="keyword">elif</span> choice == <span class="string">'u'</span>:

    <span class="keyword">elif</span> choice == <span class="string">'l'</span>:
        <span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">'Here are the contents of the shelve'</span>, fname, <span class="string">':'</span>
        <span class="keyword">for</span> key <span class="keyword">in</span> db:

<hr />
<p><sup>*</sup> Controllers are ubiquitous in computing. If you have a device or
server you want to manipulate through software then you need a controller.
</p>
<p><sup>**</sup> Which may have you thinking that it should be possible to build a
universal controller which with some OOP and an MVC architecture it pretty
much is. OOP will be the subject of the remaining four modules of this
course. MVC you can either Google or wait to study in NCIT 212.</p>
