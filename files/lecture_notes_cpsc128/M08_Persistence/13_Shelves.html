<h1>Shelves</h1>
<p>A shelve* is like a dictionary that is stored on disk. (The name continues
the canning theme begun with pickle). The dictionary values can be any object
that can be pickled. Retrieval is fast because the dictionary keys are hashed
for fast retrieval.</p>
<p>Here is an example that stores quotations into a shelve on disk. The
comments should make it self-explanatory.</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="comment"># shelve_test.py</span>
<span class="keyword">import</span> shelve
<span class="comment"># First here are a couple of quotes to work with.</span>
b = [<span class="string">'Kent Beck'</span>, <span class="string">'Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming: testing is the treatment.'</span>]
k = [<span class="string">'Brian Kernighan'</span>, <span class="string">'Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.'</span>]
<span class="comment"># Now let's create an in-RAM dictionary with the quotes in it.</span>
quotes = {}
<span class="comment"># Add the quotes to the dictionary keyed by last name.</span>
quotes[<span class="string">'Kernighan'</span>] = k
quotes[<span class="string">'Beck'</span>] = b
<span class="comment"># Now let's display what we have:</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">'Here<span class="escape">\'</span>s the dictionary:'</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> quotes
<span class="keyword">print</span>
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">'Here it is again by looping through it:'</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> person <span class="keyword">in</span> quotes.keys():
    <span class="keyword">print</span> quotes[person]
<span class="keyword">print</span>
<span class="comment"># Now let's create a shelve and put the quotes in it.</span>
<span class="comment"># Like a file we open it, but unlike with a file</span>
<span class="comment"># opening a shelve is non-destructive so you can reopen it as often</span>
<span class="comment"># as you want.</span>
quotefile = shelve.open(<span class="string">'quotes'</span>)
<span class="comment"># Notice how the access syntax mirrors the dictionary syntax above.</span>
quotefile[<span class="string">'Kernighan'</span>] = k
quotefile[<span class="string">'Beck'</span>] = b
quotefile.close()
<span class="comment"># The quotes should be stored on-disk now.</span>
<span class="comment"># Let's reopen the shelve and display the quotes.</span>
quotefile = shelve.open(<span class="string">'quotes'</span>)
<span class="keyword">print</span> <span class="string">'Here<span class="escape">\'</span>s the content of the shelve:'</span>
<span class="comment"># Notice how similar this is to working with the in-memory dictionary above.</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> key <span class="keyword">in</span> quotefile:
    <span class="keyword">print</span> key, <span class="string">':'</span>, quotefile[key]
quotefile.close()</code></pre>
<p>The example shows how to store and retrieve data with the shelve, but what
about deleting a stored item? Just use <code>del
<em>dictionary</em>[<em>key</em>]</code> or in the specific example above we
could use <code>del quotefile['Beck']</code> to remove the Kent Beck
quote.</p>
<h2>A small gotcha</h2>
<p>Brian Kernighan is a very smart guy and has said many memorable things.
What if we add a second quote by him to the shelve? Well if we use the same
key, i.e. his last name <code>Kernighan</code>, it will replace the existing
quote. What to do? One view is that last name was not a good choice for the
key because it is not unique to the items being stored, i.e. two items can
have the same key. Another is that it is a fine key, but the values in the
dictionary should be a list of the quotes by Brian Kernighan not a single
list element giving one quote, i.e. the entry should be a list of lists. In
either case we probably want to be able to tell if we already have any quotes
by him already and we can do that using the shelve's <code>has_key</code>
method,</p>
<pre><code>if quotefile.has_key('Kernighan'):
   # deal with it...</code></pre>
