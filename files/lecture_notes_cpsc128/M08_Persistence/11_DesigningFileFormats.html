<h1>Designing file formats</h1>
<p>In the previous example we stored our coordinates "one pair to a line
separated by white space". That description specifies a file format. Of
course it's not the only file format possible. We could have put all the
data onto one line, or separated items with commas instead of spaces, or...
The limits to what we could design are just the limits of our ingenuity.</p>
<p>The differences of one versus many lines, and commas versus spaces are
just cosmetic, but sometimes quite different approaches can be taken to storing
some data. One accessible problem that affords different alternatives is the
problem of storing the state of the universe in Conway's Game of Life. You
can read about this "game" on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia</a> and
play it online <a href="http://www.radicaleye.com/lifepage/">here</a> (click
on the image at the top of the page), <a
href="http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/">here</a> or <a
href="http://psych.hanover.edu/JavaTest/Play/Life.html">here</a> (among many
others).</p>
<p>The universe in Conway's game of life is a grid of cells each of which can be in
one of two states: alive or dead. A natural way to represent it in Python
would be as a list of lists of cells (like a very large tic-tac-toe
board):</p>
<pre><code class="python">universe = [ [<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>],
             [<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>],
             [<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>],
             [<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>],
             [<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>],
             [<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>],
             [<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>],
             [<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">0</span>]
           ]</code></pre>
<h2>Option 1</h2>
<p>One way to write this to a text file would be to write lines of space-separated
0s and 1s to the file:</p>
<pre><code>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</code></pre>
<p>The size of this file would be 136 bytes because we have one byte for the
0 or 1 for each cell, 1 byte for the space to separate them, and 1 byte for
the line end marking the end of each row of the universe, i.e. 1 &times; 8
&times; 8 + 1 &times; 8 &times; 8 + 1 &times; 8 = 136 bytes. Generalizing
this, an <em>n</em> &times; <em>n</em> universe would require
2<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>n</em> bytes.</p>
<h2>Option 2</h2>
<p>Using text graphics the universe might be displayed onscreen using blanks
to represent dead cells and asterisks to represent live cells like this:</p>
<pre><code>   *
    *
  ***</code></pre>
<p>This suggests a second approach: we could save the state of the universe
by taking a "snapshot" of it and writing that snapshot to the file. Our file
would look just like the universe, and would use somewhat less storage
because this time we use one byte (to store a blank or an asterisk character)
for each cell and one byte for the newline at the end of each row. Thus for
an <em>n</em><em></em> &times; <em>n</em> universe we would require
<em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>n</em> bytes or roughly half as much storage
(for medium and large values of <em>n</em>). For our 8 &times; 8 universe this
approach uses 72 bytes.</p>
<h2>Option 3</h2>
<p>You will have noticed when playing the online games of life (you did play
them didn't you?) that the universe is usually "sparse", that is there are
usually relatively few live cells among a great many dead ones. This is a
consequence of Conway's rules: cells die easily of overcrowding, so if an area
becomes densely populated the cells in it quickly die off keeping overall
densities low. This suggests that we may be wasting space storing all those dead
cells. Instead we should just store the locations of live cells. Our file
format for the universe above would then be:</p>
<pre><code>8 8
2 3
3 4
4 2
4 3
4 4</code></pre>
<p>where each row after the first one records the location of one live cell in <em>row
col</em> form, i.e. the first number gives the row of the cell and the second gives
its column. What about the 8s in the first row? With this representation the
file does not directly convey the size of the universe as it did in the first
two options so we must explicitly state the size of the universe; it's the
job of the first line of data to give the height and width of the
universe.</p>
<p>The storage requirement of this option depends not on the size of the
universe, but on the number of live cells in it. For a universe less than 11
&times; 11 in size it uses 4 bytes per live cell (1 for row, 1 for separating
space, 1 for col and 1 for line end), plus another 4 for the universe size.
Generalizing: 4<em>n</em> + 4 bytes where <em>n</em> gives the number of live
cells.</p>
<p>(Note that the memory storage is <em>affected</em> by the size of the
universe just not solely determined by it. This is because more bytes are
required to represent the row and column coordinates the larger the universe
is. In a 1,000 &times; 1,000 universe most coordinates will be 3 digit
numbers, e.g. (148, 763) so most lines will be 8 bytes long and the formula
will become 8<em>n</em> + 8 bytes).</p>
<p>How does this compare with the first two options? For this specific
example it uses 24 bytes. As long as the universe is sparse it will be more
efficient, but for a crowded universe it will be less efficient. We can
calculate the point at which it ceases to become more efficient by finding
the number of live cells at which the storage for the two schemes is equal.
Assuming a 1,000 &times; 1,000 universe, Option 1 will require 2,001,000
bytes, Option 2 will require 1,001,000 bytes, and Option 3's requirements
will vary with the number of live cells:</p>
<table class="finelines">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>% live cells</th>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Storage in bytes</th>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>400,008</td>
      <td>800,008</td>
      <td>1,200,008</td>
      <td>1,600,008</td>
      <td>2,000,008</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>You can see that for this size of universe the break even point is around
12.5% live cells.</p>
<h2>Option 4</h2>
<p>There are numerous other options, but one that often occurs to students is
that since cells are either dead or alive their state could be stored using
a single bit rather than an entire byte. This would reduce the storage
requirements by a factor of 8 in the first two options. It is indeed possible
to do this helped along by <a
href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#binary-bitwise-operations">Python's
binary operators</a> which allow us to manipulate the bits inside bytes, but
these are not a focus of the course so we will just nod at this possibility
as we move on by. (There are also fussy end conditions to deal with when the
universe is not a multiple of 8 in size because then our information does not
exactly fill bytes).</p>
<h2>Why no code?</h2>
<p>Because it's part of the assignment!</p>
