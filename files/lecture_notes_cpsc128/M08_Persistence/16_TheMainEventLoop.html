<h1>The main event loop</h1>
<p>You've already seen it. Go back to the previous page and look at the
controller code. See the main loop that awaits an event from the user to
trigger each action? That's a <em>main event loop</em>. It's the most common
pattern for interactive (as opposed to batch) programs. They wait for each
event or user action, e.g. a keypress or a mouse movement, and then trigger
an action based on it. Most office productivity programs (word processors,
spreadsheets, etc.) spend almost all of their time waiting for the user to do
something and then just follow a clear set of rules to determine what routine
to fire as a result. "The main event loop" is just jargon, not a deep idea,
but its jargon you should know, and even use, e.g. in
interviews.</p>
