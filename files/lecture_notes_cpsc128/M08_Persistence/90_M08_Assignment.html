<h1>Assignment 8</h1>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Text file practice</h3>
    <p>Write a module containing three functions. When run, the module should
    prompt the user for a filename and a number of lines (let's refer to it as
    <code>n</code>) and then call each function in turn with these
    parameters.</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><p>The function <code>head</code> should return a list containing the
        first <code>n</code> lines of the file.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>The function <code>tail</code> should return a list containing the
        last <code>n</code> lines of the file.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>The function <code>longest</code> should return a list containing
        the longest <code>n</code> lines of the file. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The output of running the module might look like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Name of file to test with: pooh.txt
Number of lines to display: 3

head says the first 3 lines are:
The more it snows
  (Tiddely pom),
The more it goes

tail says the last 3 lines are:
 How cold my toes
  (Tiddely pom),
 Are growing.

longest says the longest 3 lines are:
The more it snows
The more it goes
And nobody knows
    </code></pre>
    <p>Since the file could be very long you will <strong>not</strong> want to
    read the whole thing into memory as a list of lines... </p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Testing <code>biggest()</code></h3>
    <p>The last few assignments have provided you with examples of testing
    harnesses to ensure programs are working correctly. Now it is time for you
    to design some tests of your own. The file <a href="a8_2.py">a8_2.py</a>
    contains six versions of a function named <code>biggest</code> that all
    claim to return the largest of three values they are passed. Add test cases
    to the program to determine which ones (if any) work correctly. Based on
    your test cases identify the situations (if any) in which each version
    fails, and the reason for the failure, i.e. what the problem is with the
    code. Enter your answers into the docstrings for each function.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>CRUD Control</h3>
    <p>Complete the program <a
    href="crud_controller.py">crud_controller.py</a>, i.e. insert code for the
    remaining functions, and make sure adding new quotes can't delete existing
    ones. Rename it a8p3v1.py.</p>
  </li>
<!--  <li><h3>Report Generation</h3>
    <p>Write a function called <code>summarize</code> that is passed the name
    of a file whose contents are formatted like this,</p>
    <pre>Asia:Japan:120:144
North America:Mexico:78:762
Europe:England:56:94
Asia:USSR:275:8649
Europe:Germany:61:96
South America:Brasil:134:3286

North America:Canada:25:3852
Europe:France:55:211
Asia:India:746:1267</pre>
    <p>and returns a string containing a report formatting the data like
    this,</p>
    <pre>CONTINENT       COUNTRY    POPULATION       AREA       POP. DEN.

    <p>The file <a href="a8_4.py">a8_4.py</a> contains a program to test your
    function.</p>
  </li>-->
  <li><h3>Super hero name generator</h3>
  <p>Write a function called <code>superhero_name_generator</code> that is passed a string containing someone's full name, e.g. <code>'Timothy Nicholas Topper'</code>, and returns their superhero name according to the chart below, e.g. my superhero name is Outlandish Psychic Tornado.</p>
  <p>Put your function in a module with an <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> section that tests it.</p.
    ><p><img src="SuperheroNameGenerator.jpg"></p>
    <!--<h3>Weather Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>The file <a href="weather.txt">weather.txt</a> contains many years worth
    of Whitehorse temperature data beginning in 1942.</p>
    <p>The file begins with three header lines. After that each line contains 3
    values: the month number, the day of the month, and the daily maximum
    temperature.</p>
    <p>Write a program that answers the following questions.</p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>What are the hottest and coldest days, months and years recorded in
        the file?</li>
      <li>What was the greatest temperature swing from one day to the next?</li>
      <li>What was the longest run of days over which the temperature steadily
        increased, i.e. in which each day's maximum temperature was warmer than
        the day before's?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your program should make a single pass over the file. (Note: While you
    should strive for a single program that makes a single pass through the
    data, you may want to begin by writing separate small programs to answer
    each question, and then combine them into a single program.)</p>
    <p>Your output might look like this but with x's replaced by values (though
    there are more attractive possibilities):</p>
    <pre><code> 
                  Temperature Summary
             (All temperatures in Celsius)
 
Warmest day:             xxx xx 19xx (temp = xx C).
Coldest day:             xxx xx 19xx (temp = xx C).
Warmest month:           xxx 19xx (avg temp = xx C)
Coldest month:           xxx 19xx (avg temp = xx C)
Warmest year:            19xx (avg temp = xx C)
Coldest year:            19xx (avg temp = xx C)
Biggest one day change:  xx degrees from xxx xx to xxx xx, 19xx.
Longest warming series:  xx days from xxx xx to xxx xx 19xx.</code></pre>-->
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the following naming scheme for your program files: <code>a</code><em>assignment#</em><code>p</code><em>problem#</em><code>v</code><em>version#</em><code>.py</code> . So your first attempt at problem 1 on this assignment will be named <code>a8p1v1.py</code> and your second attempt (should there be one) will
      be named <code>a8p1v2.py</code> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your assignment by emailing your python programs to me. I advise you to submit early and submit often, since I will often review your programs as they are submitted and provide feedback that will let you improve them.</p>
