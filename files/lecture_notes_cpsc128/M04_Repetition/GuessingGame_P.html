<h1>Problem: The guessing game</h1>
<p>There is a guessing game children are fond of in which one player chooses
a number between 1 and 100 and the other player must guess it. The only
feedback given the guesser is whether their most recent guess was too high or
too low. The game ends when the number has been guessed. If a long car ride
is involved then the players might keep track of how many guesses they have
taken over a number of games.</p>
<p>Write a program that 'plays' this game by picking a number and then
accepting guesses about the number's value. After each guess it should inform
the user if the guess was too high or too low. The game should end when the
number is guessed, at which point the computer should display the number of
guesses taken.</p>
