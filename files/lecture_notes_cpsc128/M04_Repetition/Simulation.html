<h1>Simulation</h1>
<p>In a simulation problem we write a program that simulates a real world
process, relying on our ability to generate random numbers to take account of
the uncertainty of real-world processes like whether newborns are girls or
boys, how long it will take to unload an airplane, the chances a vehicle will
turn left or right or go straight. If we do this enough times we can make a
reliable estimate of the probability of a real-world event occurring.</p>
<p>Because we are usually simulating to find out what will happen only
because we don't already know what will actually happen they are notoriously
difficult to test. Unlike a conversion program where we know some correct
values we can use to test our program, in a simulation correct values can be
hard to find. Consider for example models of climate change. They make quite
different predictions so they can't all be right, and the only sure test is
to wait 5, 10 or 50 years to find out which one is right.</p>
