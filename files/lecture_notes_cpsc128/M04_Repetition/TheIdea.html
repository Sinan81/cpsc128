<h1>The idea: Go back up and repeat some code</h1>
<p>Until now our programs have been strictly sequential executing from top to
bottom. With the <code>if</code> statement we were able to select some statements to
execute and others to skip, but execution still flowed from top to bottom.
However some processing  requires us to go back up in a program
to repeat sections of code a second time (or a third and and a fourth and so
on). </p>
<p>Think back to this bit of code from the previous module:</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="TheIdea1.png" width="493" height="148" />
</p>
<p>It instructs the user to enter a grade to convert and then had a long
section testing the entered value to calculate the corresponding letter
grade. We discovered that between the input and selection we needed to test
the grade to ensure it was valid. If it was invalid we were able to avoid
processing it and producing mistaken output, and even to explain their error
to the user, but we were not able to give them the chance to reenter the
value. What we need is some way to go back up and give them a second chance
as shown by the red arrow below.</p>
<p class="img"><img alt="." src="TheIdea2.png" width="566" height="156" /></p>
<p>So far though we don't have a statement or construct that lets us "go back
up" if the grade is invalid and repeat the execution of some code. This is
what repetition constructs enable us to do: to repeat code as many times as
necessary. </p>
