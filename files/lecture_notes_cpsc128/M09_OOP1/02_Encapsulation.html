<h1>Encapsulation</h1>
<p>The first benefit of OOP is that it allows for <em>encapsulation</em>.
This just means that an object encapsulates (or hides) how it operates from
the code that invokes it. We have benefitted, for example, by being able to
use Python's lists and dictionaries without having to worry about how they
are implemented internally. That's because they <em>abstract</em> the
behaviour to encapsulate their functionality and hide the implementation
details from us.</p>
<p>Encapsulation is necessary in OOP so objects can interact
  with each other without needing to know the details of how each other
  operates. In fact complete encapsulation allows for an object type to be
  rewritten and dropped into a working program without any of the other program
  components needing to be aware of the change.</p>
<p>This is not as magical as it
  might sound. If the next version of Python changes the internal storage of
  dictionaries we will never know as long as it behaves the same as the current
  implementation and our programs keep working. As programmers got used to this
  their attention was drawn to the importance of object interfaces, since as
  long as the interface, or behaviour, is maintained, the implementation can be changed at
  will. Some languages, including Python, have features or practices that allow
  class interfaces to be formally specified. The programmer's focus then is on
  "programming to the interface".</p>
