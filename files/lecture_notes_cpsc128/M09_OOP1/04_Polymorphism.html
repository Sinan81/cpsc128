<h1>Polymorphism</h1>
<p>Programmers noticed another regularity among their objects: often many of
them needed to be able to respond to the same message, but by doing somewhat
different things. For example we <em>add</em> items to a list, and to a
dictionary, and to a menu, etc. In this case we want all these object types to
be able to respond to an <code>add</code> message, i.e. to provide
an <code>add</code> method. Of course in Python we don't always know what
type of object a name refers to, <code>list[3]</code> could be another list,
or a menu, or a string, etc. The ability to be able to say
<code>list[3].add(thing)</code> and have the language interpreter figure out
what to do is <em>polymorphism</em>. More technically it is the ability for an
operation to trigger different behaviours in different contexts. An concrete
example we have seen of this is the behaviour of the + operator: it
<em>adds</em> numbers, </p>
<pre>x = y <strong>+</strong> 5</pre>
<p><em>appends</em> strings,</p>
<pre>salutation = 'Mr.' <strong>+</strong> last_name</pre>
<p>and <em>extends</em> lists,</p>
<pre>t = [3, 7] <strong>+</strong> [6, 2]</pre>
<p>In each case the semantics of the <code>+</code> operator is different
because the operation performed depends on the types of the objects it is
working with. </p>
<p>When fully utilized polymorphism allows us to add new object types to the
Python language. For example if we need to work a lot with invoices we can
define an invoice type that can be printed, added to, subtracted from,
multiplied by, iterated over etc. This ability to extend the language allows
it to be customized to suit any given problem domain and has been a powerful
driver for the adoption of object-oriented programming.</p>
