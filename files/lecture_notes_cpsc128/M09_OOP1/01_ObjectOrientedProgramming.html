<h1>Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
<p>So far we have been doing <strong>procedural, object-based programming</strong>.</p>
<p>In
  <strong>procedural programming</strong> the programmer specifies the <em>procedure</em> to follow to
  solve a problem. As you have discovered, this procedure consists of a series of step-by-step instructions and must be specified
  quite precisely.
  Although some large programs are procedural, e.g. the Linux kernel and the
  Apache web server, the larger they become the more difficult they are to
  compose. Large procedural programs tend to become fragile, and it can be
  difficult to reuse the code in them. </p>
<p>Our programming became <strong>object-based</strong> when our procedures began to operate
on objects. Object operations came with their own jargon of objects, methods
and messages. For example when we write</p>
<pre><code>a_list.append('Tom')</code></pre>
<p>we are invoking the <code>append</code> <em>method</em> of the list
<em>object</em> <code>a_list</code>. We might also say we are sending the
object <code>a_list</code> the <em>message</em> <code>append</code>. Objects
package data (e.g. the data inside <code>a_list</code> above) and the code to
operate on it (e.g. the <code>append</code> method) together into convenient
units that are easy to use, and to <strong>reuse</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Object-oriented programming</strong> (OOP) we go beyond using pre-existing classes and learn how to create new classes of our own. This gives us the ability to extend the basic types Python provides. Wish Python provided dice and playing_cards in addition to numbers and strings? Just add them to the language by defining new classes for each. Along with this ability comes a new perspective on program building. Rather than focussing on the procedural specification
of what has to be done, OOP views the execution of a program as an interaction
between  objects that send messages to each other. In response to
these messages the objects carry out (internal) processing and  retain state
(store results). The emphasis in object-oriented programming is on the design
and coding of these objects.</p>
<p>OOP comes with even more impressive jargon than object-based programming.
The three key aspects of OOP are <em>encapsulation</em>,
<em>inheritance</em> and <em>polymorphism</em>. The ideas are not as
difficult as their forbidding names suggest and this module and the next two
are essentially long explanations with examples of these three concepts. To
get started though here are brief explanations of these concepts to introduce them to
you and give you a general idea of what they are about.</p>
