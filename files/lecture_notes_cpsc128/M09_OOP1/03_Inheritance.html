<h1>Inheritance</h1>
<p>Experience creating objects soon showed programmers that many objects
shared features, e.g. several might have text blocks, or creation dates, or screen positions, and they
realized that they could further reduce the amount of new code they had to
write if they could reuse existing code by having one type of object
<em>inherit</em> behaviour and properties from another. Then if the
ancestor's behaviour or properties were updated the descendant would
instantly inherit the improvements. This can lead to large hierarchies of
object types; some define thousands of object types. To give you a flavour of
a type hierarchy here is a medium-sized inheritance hierarchy for a Python-based
internet application development platform:</p>

<p>Inheritance hierarchies are easiest to read bottom up. For example, if we begin at the lower right the
chart above tells us that a <code>FlexTable</code> is a kind of
<code>HTMLTable</code> which is in turn a kind of
<code>Panel</code> which is a kind of <code>Widget</code> which
is a kind of <code>UIObject</code>. What this means is that if we improve our code for <code>Panel</code>s, <code>Widget</code>s and <code>UIObject</code>s will instantly and transparently inherit these improvements as well without us having to modify their code at all.</p>
