<h1>Assignment 7</h1>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Every letter counts</h3>
    <p>First up a problem to give you a little practice working with the collection
    types (lists and dictionaries). Write the following implementations of the
    function <code>letter_frequency</code> that takes a string and returns a
    collection type showing how often each letter of the alphabet occurs in the
    string.</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><p>The first version (<code>letter_frequencyA</code>) should return a
        list with 26 integer elements representing the frequency of occurrence
        of each letter of the alphabet in order from a to z. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>The second version (<code>letter_frequencyB</code>) should return
        a list of 26 lists, each of which contains a letter and its associated
        count.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>The third version (<code>letter_frequencyC</code>) should return a
        dictionary that uses the letters as keys and whose values are the
        letters' counts. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The program that will call these functions is <a
    href="letter_frequency.py"><code>letter_frequency.py</code></a>.
    Your job is to replace the <code>pass</code> statements with function
    bodies that implement the functionality specified above. Studying the
    embedded tests should answer any other questions you have about the
    functions' operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Anagrams</h3>
    <p>An anagram is produced by rearranging the letters of one word or phrase
    to produce another word or phrase, e.g. "cat" and "act" are anagrams, as
    are "scare", "races", "acres" and "cares". Write two functions called
    <code>anagramsA</code> and <code>anagramsB</code> each of which returns True if the
    two strings it is passed are anagrams of each other and False otherwise.
    <code>anagramsA</code> should be based on the observation that if two
    strings are anagrams they each have the same numbers of each letter in
    them. This means that their letter frequency counts will be identical.
    <code>anagramsB</code> should be based on the observation that anagrams are
    strings that could be rearranged to be the same. One easy way to rearrange
    things is to use Python's built-in sort methods, so you could test to see
    if two strings are anagrams by sorting them and comparing the sorted
    versions.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Win 32 Network Resource Anlayzer</h3>
    <p>Many of the Win32 Network Resource enumeration tools return a list
    of dictionaries:</p>
    <pre><code>[ {'name':'YVB127','comment':'Rm A2507','type':WKSTATION},
  {'name':'YVB143','comment':'Rm T1010','type':SERVER},
  ...
]</code></pre>
    <p>Write the following functions to work with the <code>import</code>'ed
    file <a
    href="http://courses.yukoncollege.yk.ca/~ttopper/CPSC128.W14/M07_Dictionaries/net_res.py">net_res.py</a>:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><code>count_summary()</code> should return a dictionary where the
        machine type is the key and the count of machines of that type is the
        value.</li>
      <li><code>list_by_type(type)</code> should be passed a type, e.g. SERVER
        and return a list of the rooms containing machines of that type.</li>
      <li><code>max_count()</code> should return the name of the room, e.g. 'Rm
        A2507', that contains the most computers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Embed your functions in a module with an <code>if __name__</code>... block that runs
    them and displays their output. It should import the
    file<code>net_res.py</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Topography</h3>
    <p>No dictionaries required for this one. It just gives you some more
    practice working with lists of lists. Suppose you are given some map
    elevation data stored as a list of lists, e.g. </p>
    <pre><code>data = [ [20, 54, 50, 64, 60, 63, 60, 48, 20, 20],
         [20, 56, 72, 76, 72, 20, <span style="color: orange;">52</span>, <span style="color: orange;">62</span>, <span style="color: orange;">53</span>, 20],
         [20, 52, 62, 81, 67, 23, <span style="color: orange;">48</span>, <strong><span style="color: red;">67</span></strong>, <span style="color: orange;">52</span>, 20],
         [20, 54, <span style="color: orange;">54</span>, <span style="color: orange;">82</span>, <span style="color: orange;">72</span>, 22, <span style="color: orange;">42</span>, <span style="color: orange;">64</span>, <span style="color: orange;">50</span>, 20],
         [20, 53, <span style="color: orange;">49</span>, <strong><span style="color: red;">87</span></strong>, <span style="color: orange;">69</span>, 47, 48, 49, 21, 20],
         [20, 20, <span style="color: orange;">62</span>, <span style="color: orange;">71</span>, <span style="color: orange;">61</span>, 36, 28, 31, 22, 20],
         [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 22, 21, 28, 24, 20],
         [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20],
         [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20],
         [20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20]
       ]</code></pre>
    <p>Write a function called <code>peaks</code> that is passed a list of
    lists like this one and returns a list of the coordinates (row, col) of all
    the peaks in the dataset. A peak is a point that is higher than its eight
    surrounding neighbours (the red values at (2,7) and (4,3)
    above are the peaks and the orange values aroung them are their eight neighbours). For the data set above the function should return,</p>
    <pre><code>[(2, 6), (4, 3)]</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the following naming scheme for your program files: <code>a</code><em>assignment#</em><code>p</code><em>problem#</em><code>v</code><em>version#</em><code>.py</code> . So your first attempt at problem 1 on this assignment will be named <code>a7p1v1.py</code> and your second attempt (should there be one) will
      be named <code>a7p1v2.py</code> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your assignment by emailing your python programs to me. I advise to submit early and submit often, since I will often review your programs as they are submitted and provide feedback that will let you improve them.</p>
