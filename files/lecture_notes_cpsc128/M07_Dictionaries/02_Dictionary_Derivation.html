<h1>Dictionary "derivation"</h1>
<h2>Think back</h2>
<p>Earlier we saw that we could use a list as an array of counters, e.g. to
calculate <a
href="http://courses.yukoncollege.yk.ca/~ttopper/CPSC128.W14/M05_ListsAndStrings/DiceOdds.html">dice
odds</a>. The trick there was to map the outcomes of rolling a pair of fair
dice, i.e. 2, 3, 4, ..., 11, 12, onto the entries in a list. Since lists are
numbered from 0, we did that by subtracting 2 from each dice outcome. This
mapped outcomes to counters as follows,</p>
<table border="0" style="margin: auto;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Dice outcome</th>
      <td style="width: 50px;"></td>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Counter</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">2</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[0]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">3</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[1]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">4</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[2]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">11</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[9]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">12</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[10]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a nice little trick and programmers used similar ones to map all
sorts of types onto list indexes so they could count them (or store
information associated with them).</p>
<h2>Counting letters</h2>
<p>For example if you want to count letters you need to map the letters of
the alphabet onto counters like this,</p>
<table border="0" style="margin: auto;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Letter</th>
      <td style="width: 50px;"></td>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Counter</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">'a'</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[0]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">'b'</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[1]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">'c'</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[2]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">'y'</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[24]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">'z'</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[25]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>This was done by taking advantage of the properties by which characters
are stored in memory.</p>
<p>Since the days of teletypes characters had to be represented digitally and
so there was an encoding for them. The most common for a long time was
ASCII*. This specified the binary encoding for the common keyboard characters
and control codes as shown e.g. <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">in this
table</a>. You can see the control codes teletypes required in the first 32
positions, followed by some special characters and digits, the capital
letters, some more special characters, the lower case alphabet, and finally a
few more special characters. Thankfully for the tricks below the letters were
kept in sequence without intervening special characters. Most languages
provide functions to get the ASCII value of a character. In Python this
function is <code>ord</code>, (for <strong>ord</strong>inal position)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ord('a')
97
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Its inverse which returns a character corresponding to an ASCII code is
<code>chr</code>,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; chr(97)
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>ord</code> we can implement the mapping above by subtracting
97 (or more readably <code>ord('a')</code>) from the ordinal values of the
characters,</p>
<pre><code class="python">test_str =<span class="string">'astringalingding'</span>
counters = <span class="number">26</span>*[<span class="number">0</span>] <span class="comment"># Initialize list of counters to be 26 0s.</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> ch <span class="keyword">in</span> test_str:
    <span class="comment"># Calculate index of counter for this letter in counters.</span>
    index = ord(ch) - ord(<span class="string">'a'</span>)
    <span class="comment"># Increment appropriate counter.</span>
    counters[index] = counters[index] + <span class="number">1</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> index <span class="keyword">in</span> range(<span class="number">26</span>):
    <span class="comment"># Display letter corresponding to this index and its count.</span>
    <span class="keyword">print</span> chr(ord(<span class="string">'a'</span>)+index), counters[index]</code></pre>
<p>Try it, and examine the output. Note how fragile the code is, e.g. insert
a space into <code>test_str</code>, or a capital letter. (Don't worry you'll
get to make it more robust on the assignment.)</p>
<h2>The limits of ingenuity...</h2>
<p>Both these tricks we have seen for mapping sequences onto lists are
ingenious but programmers' ingenuity hit a temporary stumbling block when
they wanted to count the occurrences of words. At first it seems
straightforward. We just need to map words onto counters something like
this,</p>
<table border="0" style="margin: auto;">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:center;">word</th>
      <td style="width: 50px;"></td>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Counter</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">'cat'</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[0]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">'dog'</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[1]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">'pie'</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">&rarr;</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">counters[2]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
      <td style="text-align:center;">...</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>But there are problems.</p>
<p>First our mappings from dice outcomes and letters to counters were based
on the fact that they were both short sequences. The list of possible words
is not short: the English language alone boasts roughly a million words and
this is without counting proper names like the names of people and
places. We can hardly initialize a list of a million counters each time we
need to count the occurrences of words in some paragraph.</p>
<p>Second, it's not easy to see how to map 'cat' onto 0 and 'pie' onto 2. In
our first two examples we were able to do so using simple arithmetic to deal
with an offset between the two sequences first by subtracting 2 and then by
subtracting 97. Here simple arithmetic will not suffice.</p>
<h2>... call for greater ingenuity ...</h2>
<p>Programmers tried numerous arithmetic tricks to map words onto indices.
For example we could try adding together the ASCII codes for the letters in
the words so 'cat' becomes ord('c') + ord('a') + ord('t') = 99 + 97 + 116 =
312 while 'dog' becomes ord('d') + ord('o') + ord('g') = 100 + 111 + 103 =
314. This works nicely for 'cat' and 'dog', but 'dog' and 'god' end up having
the same code (as do all acronyms) which won't do.</p>
<p>To distinguish 'dog' and 'god' we have to take account of the order of the
letters. One way to do this draws its inspiration from numbers. After all 574
and 475 are made from the same digits but we don't confuse them because the
position of the numbers matters: 574 means "5 hundreds, 7 tens, and 4 ones"
whereas 475 means "4 hundreds, 7 tens and 5 ones". We can adapt this
positional scheme to code our strings. If 574 means (5 &times; 100) + (7
&times; 10) + (4 &times; 1) or (5 &times; 10<sup>2</sup>) + (7 &times;
10<sup>1</sup>) + (4 &times; 10<sup>0</sup>) then by analogy cat should mean
(3 &times; 26<sup>2</sup>) + (1 &times; 26<sup>1</sup>) + (20 &times;
26<sup>0</sup>) &mdash; because c, a and t are the 3rd, 1st and 20th letters
of the alphabet. Here's a function that calculates this kind of a string
index,</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">string_index</span><span class="params">( s )</span>:</span>
    index = <span class="number">0</span>
    <span class="keyword">for</span> i <span class="keyword">in</span> range(len(s)):
        index = index + (ord(s[-i]) - ord(<span class="string">'a'</span>) + 1) * <span class="number">26</span>**i
    <span class="keyword">return</span> index
        
<span class="keyword">print</span> string_index(<span class="string">'cat'</span>)
<span class="keyword">print</span> string_index(<span class="string">'dictionary'</span>)</code></pre>
<p>(Note the use of the negative index in <code>s[-i]</code> to access the
letters of the word from the back to the front, and <code>- ord('a') +
1</code> to get the letter's position in the alphabet).</p>
<p>This gives us unique numbers for words, but they get large quickly. 'cat's
index is a modest 1199, but 'dictionary's is 49,655,615,398,718 which makes
us long to deal with a mere million counters (that's 49
<strong>trillion</strong>).</p>
<h2>... which calls for even greater ingenuity</h2>
<p>Ingenuity knows few bounds so there are fixes of course. We can reduce
large numbers to small ones by, for example, using modulo, %. If we want to
limit ourselves to a list with 1,000 counters we can just use %1000 and our
numbers will all be scaled into the range 0-999. Of course we may have
collisions between indices whose last three digits are the same if we do
that, but we can watch for that situation and handle it. We might also run
out of counters if we have more than 1,000 unique words, but we can watch for
that too and enlarge the list of counters if and when it happens. Are there
risks of errors? Yes. Are there performance costs? Yes again (testing for
collisions takes time; resizing a list takes more time). In all it took
programmers a couple of decades of sustained development effort to iron out
the major problems. In fact it remains an ongoing area of development in
which no best solution is known. But the libraries of major languages contain
robust efficient code for doing just this, and that code lies behind the
implementation of dictionaries/hash tables/collections/mappings.</p>
<p>The <code>string_index</code> function above is called a <em>hashing</em>
function. A <em>hash</em> is a unique identifier. In Python most objects can
be hashed, not just strings. In fact you can see the internal hash for an
object just by calling the built-in <code>hash</code> function, </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hash('cat')
405875055
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash('dicitonary')
-426043516</code></pre>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A dictionary works by using a hashing function to get a unique numerical
identifier (hash) for an object, and then using that hash to locate the data
associated with the object (typically in a list). As long as the hashing
function can be computed quickly, and is unique, dictionaries can be almost
as fast as lists and yet allow for readable, meaningful indexes.</p>
<p></p>
<hr />
<p>* ASCII is being slowly superseded by Unicode because the latter can
handle all the characters in all human languages rather than just the few
that appear on North American keyboards. Python 3 for example uses Unicode
exclusively for its strings. Most other languages are still some ways from
providing robust Unicode processing.</p>
