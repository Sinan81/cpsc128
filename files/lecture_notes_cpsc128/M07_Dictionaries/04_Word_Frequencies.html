<h1>Example: Word Frequencies</h1>
<p>Now that we have seen dictionary syntax let's put it to work and solve
the problem of counting the frequencies of the words in a string. The input
will be a string, and the desired output is a display of each word and the
number of times it occurred in the string. We'll use a dictionary for our
counters where each key-value pair in the dictionary will consist of a word
and the number of times it occurred. </p>
<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<p>The pseudocode description might be,</p>
<pre><code>get the string
break the string into a list of words
initialize a dictionary of counters
loop through the list of words
    if the word is in the dictionary
        increment its counter by 1
    otherwise
        set its counter to 1
loop through the entries in the dictionary
    for each entry display the key (the word) and the value (the count)</code></pre>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p>A straight translation into Python gives,</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="comment"># WordFrequencies.py</span>
<span class="comment"># Get the string:</span>
test_string = <span class="string">'''The programmer, who needs clarity, who must talk all day to
    a machine that demands declarations, hunkers down into a low-grade annoyance.
    It is here that the stereotype of the programmer,
    sitting in a dim room, growling from behind Coke cans, has its origins.
    The disorder of the desk, the floor; the yellow Post-It notes everywhere;
    the whiteboards covered with scrawl:
    all this is the outward manifestation of the messiness of human thought.
    The messiness cannot go into the program;
    it piles up around the programmer.
    ~ Ellen Ullman
'''</span>

<span class="comment"># Break the string into a list of words:</span>
words = test_string.split()
<span class="comment"># Initialize a dictionary of counters:</span>
word_counts = {}

<span class="comment"># Loop through the list of words:</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> word <span class="keyword">in</span> words:
    <span class="comment"># If the word is in the dictionary:</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> word_counts.has_key(word):
        <span class="comment"># Increment its counter by 1:</span>
        word_counts[word] = word_counts[word] + <span class="number">1</span>
    <span class="comment"># Otherwise:</span>
    <span class="keyword">else</span>:
        <span class="comment"># Set its counter to 1:</span>
        word_counts[word] = <span class="number">1</span>

<span class="comment"># Loop through the entries in the dictionary:</span>
<span class="keyword">for</span> word <span class="keyword">in</span> word_counts:
    <span class="comment"># Display the key value pair:</span>
    <span class="keyword">print</span> word, <span class="string">':'</span>, word_counts[word]</code></pre>
<h2>Refinements</h2>
<p>When you run it and examine the output you will see that while this is a
useful core there are some erroneous entries in the output. Among them:</p>
<pre><code>The : 3
floor; : 1
annoyance. : 1
the : 10
~ : 1</code></pre>
<p>The problems here are that,</p>
<ul>
  <li>'The' and 'the' are the same word and so their counts should be
    combined.</li>
  <li>The trailing punctuation on 'floor;' and 'annoyance.' should be removed
    since it is not part of the word, and could mislead counts since 'floor;'
    and 'floor,' would be separate entries.</li>
  <li>'~' is not a word at all and so should not be counted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Application of some string methods can fix some of these problems,</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can use the <code>lower</code> method to convert strings to all
    lower case.</li>
  <li>We can use <code>strip</code> to remove trailing (and leading)
    punctuation characters.</li>
  <li>We can use <code>isalpha</code> to test that the string is all letters
    (and thus eliminate '~').</li>
</ul>
<p>The body of the loop then becomes,</p>
<pre><code class="python"><span class="keyword">for</span> word <span class="keyword">in</span> words:
    w = word.lower()
    w = w.strip(<span class="string">'.,;:<span class="escape">\'</span>"?!()'</span>) <span class="comment"># Notice the \ to escape the ' inside the string</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> w.isalpha():
        <span class="keyword">if</span> word_counts.has_key(w):
            word_counts[w] = word_counts[w] + <span class="number">1</span>
        <span class="keyword">else</span>:
            word_counts[w] = <span class="number">1</span></code></pre>
<p>Of course <code>isalpha</code> is too blunt an instrument since we now
lose the hyphenated words, but we could deal with that too (perhaps by
writing our own little function to check that a string contains only letters
and hyphens!), though it is a matter of details we will not pursue.</p>
